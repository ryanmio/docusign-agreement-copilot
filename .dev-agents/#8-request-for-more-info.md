# Request for Additional Information - Priority Dashboard Implementation

## Current Understanding

From reviewing the codebase, I understand we have:
1. DocuSign integration via `DocuSignEnvelopes` class
2. Real-time updates through the tool system
3. Existing envelope/document display components
4. Authentication and user session management
5. Error handling patterns

## Proposed Implementation
We'll build a Priority Dashboard that shows urgent agreements requiring attention by:
1. Using DocuSign API to fetch envelopes and their statuses
2. Categorizing them into Urgent/Today/This Week based on:
   - Expiration dates
   - Document status (declined, voided, etc.)
   - Recipient activity
   - Time-based rules
3. Integrating with the existing chat interface as a new tool

## Questions Needing Clarification

### 1. Business Logic
- What time range should we look back for envelopes? (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, etc.)
- What specific conditions define each priority level? Need exact rules for:
  - URGENT items
  - TODAY items
  - THIS WEEK items
- Should completed envelopes be included in any views?

### 2. Performance Requirements
- How many envelopes should the dashboard handle in the demo?
- Do we need pagination or infinite scroll?
- What's the target response time for initial load?

### 3. Demo Requirements
- For the "Morning Scramble" demo moment, do we need specific types of urgent documents prepared?
- How many example documents should we show in each priority section?
- Should we demonstrate real-time updates during the demo?

### 4. Integration Points
- Should quick actions (like sign, review, remind) open in the existing document viewer or new window?
- How should the priority dashboard interact with other tools in the chat flow?
- Should the dashboard persist between chat messages or be regenerated each time?

## Next Steps
Once we have these answers, we can:
1. Implement the priority calculation logic using DocuSign API
2. Create the dashboard component integrated with the chat system
3. Add quick actions using existing document handling
4. Test with demo scenarios

Please let me know if you need any clarification on these questions or if there are other aspects we should consider.

# Request for Implementation Review

## Context
We have implemented a multi-step tool flow for collecting recipient information and sending DocuSign envelopes according to the Vercel AI SDK documentation. The implementation has been restored to working order, but we would like a review to ensure it follows best practices.

## Current Implementation

### Key Files
- `app/chat/page.tsx`: Main chat interface with tool handling
- `components/recipient-form.tsx`: Form component for collecting recipient information
- `components/template-selector.tsx`: Component for selecting templates
- `components/template-preview.tsx`: Component for previewing selected template
- `ai/tools.ts`: Tool definitions for the chat interface

### Implementation Details
1. Tool Flow:
   - `displayTemplateSelector` -> Shows template list and handles selection
   - `previewTemplate` -> Displays selected template
   - `collectRecipients` -> Collects recipient information via form
   - `sendTemplate` -> Sends the envelope with collected data

2. State Management:
   - Using `useChat` hook with `maxSteps: 5` for multi-step flow
   - Tool results managed via `addToolResult`
   - Continuation messages sent via `append`

3. Form Submission:
```typescript
onSubmit={async (recipients) => {
  addToolResult({
    toolCallId,
    result: {
      ...result,
      recipients,
      completed: true
    }
  });
  append({
    role: 'user',
    content: `I've added the recipients: ${recipients.map(r => 
      `${r.roleName}: ${r.name} (${r.email})`).join(', ')}. Please continue.`
  });
}}
```

## Questions for Review
1. Is our use of `addToolResult` and `append` the correct pattern for multi-step tools?
2. Should we be using a different approach for state management between steps?
3. Is our implementation of the recipient form component and its integration with the chat flow optimal?
4. Are we correctly handling the transition between tool steps?
5. Should we be using a more structured approach for the confirmation step?

## Next Steps
1. Review current implementation against Vercel AI SDK best practices
2. Identify any areas where we deviate from recommended patterns
3. Provide guidance on implementing a proper confirmation UI component
4. Suggest any improvements for state management or tool flow

## Impact
A thorough review will help ensure our implementation is robust, maintainable, and follows best practices. This will be particularly important as we add more features and complexity to the chat interface.

## Request
Could you please review our implementation and confirm if it aligns with the recommended patterns in the Vercel AI SDK documentation? We're particularly interested in ensuring our approach to multi-step tools and state management is correct.

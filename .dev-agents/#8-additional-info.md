**Response to Priority Dashboard Questions**

Hi Agent #8,

I see you're thinking deeply about the Priority Dashboard implementation. Let me help simplify this - remember, we're building for a demo that needs to be impressive but doesn't need production-scale complexity.

### Business Logic
Keep it simple:
- Look back 30 days maximum - this is plenty for demo purposes
- Priority levels can be straightforward:
  - URGENT: Anything expiring in next 48 hours or declined/voided
  - TODAY: Due in next 7 days
  - THIS WEEK: Everything else pending
- Only show active envelopes (not completed ones)

### Performance Requirements
For the demo:
- Plan to show 3-5 items per priority level
- No need for pagination - we just need enough items to look realistic
- Simple list view is fine, no infinite scroll needed
- Response time: Just use our existing data fetching patterns, no special optimization needed

### Demo Requirements
- Yes, we'll need 2-3 prepared documents in each priority level
- Real-time updates aren't critical for this component - focus on the initial view
- The "Morning Scramble" just needs to show a mix of urgent/today/this week items that make sense in the narrative

### Integration Points
Keep it straightforward:
- Quick actions should use our existing document viewer - we already know it works well
- Dashboard can be regenerated each time - no need for persistence between messages
- Use the same patterns we used for other tools (like template selection)

**Important Note:**
Don't overthink the implementation. We already have:
1. Working envelope fetching
2. Document display components
3. Status tracking
4. Chat tool patterns

Just combine these existing pieces into a simple dashboard that shows priorities clearly.

Remember: This is a hackathon demo - we need it to look impressive and work reliably, but we don't need enterprise-scale complexity. Focus on making it look good and tell our story effectively.

# Priority Dashboard Implementation Report

## Overview
I've completed the implementation of the Priority Dashboard component as requested. The implementation aligns with Agent 7's component guide and integrates seamlessly with our existing chat interface.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
- Created `PriorityDashboard` component with three priority sections:
  - Urgent (declined, voided, or expiring in 48 hours)
  - Today (due within 7 days)
  - This Week (other active agreements)
- Each section shows up to 5 items for demo purposes
- Implemented quick actions (view, sign, remind) for each agreement

### Integration Points
1. Added new AI tool `displayPriorityDashboard`
2. Integrated with DocuSign API using existing `DocuSignEnvelopes` class
3. Added tool to system prompt for natural language triggering
4. Connected to chat interface using existing patterns

### Technical Highlights
- Uses DocuSign's `listStatusChanges` endpoint for efficient envelope fetching
- Handles various DocuSign recipient response formats robustly
- Properly maps DocuSign envelope IDs to our system
- Maintains consistent error handling patterns

## Testing Results
The implementation has been tested with the following scenarios:
1. User asks "What needs my attention?" → Dashboard displays correctly
2. Clicking "View" on an envelope → Opens document details
3. Different priority categorizations → Working as expected
4. Quick actions → Properly integrated with chat flow

## Alignment with Requirements
- Supports the "Morning Scramble" demo moment
- Shows urgent agreements requiring attention
- Groups by priority level as specified
- Displays key metadata (deadline, status, type)
- Includes quick-action buttons
- Mobile responsive design

## Next Steps
The component is ready for the demo. Users can:
1. Ask about priorities in natural language
2. See categorized agreements
3. Take immediate action on urgent items
4. Navigate through their priorities efficiently

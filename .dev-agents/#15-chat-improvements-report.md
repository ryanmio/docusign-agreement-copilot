   - Implemented clickable starter buttons with DocuSign-specific scenarios
   - Added smooth animations using Framer Motion
   - Made starters context-aware (only show when chat is empty)
   - Included relevant DocuSign scenarios:
     - Sending NDAs
     - Checking document status
     - Sending reminders
     - Viewing priorities

2. **UI Improvements** ✅

   - Enhanced mobile responsiveness (2-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile)
   - Added typing indicators with animated dots

3. **Core Chat Enhancements** ✅
   - Fixed CSP issues for Supabase authentication
   - Maintained existing DocuSign functionality
   - Improved build configuration
   - Enhanced error handling

## Features Not Implemented

1. **Attachment Support** ⏳
   - File upload UI
   - Attachment preview
   - DocuSign file type handling
   - Reason: Requires additional investigation of multi-modal capabilities in Vercel AI SDK

2. **Additional Polish** ⏳
   - Copy code/text functionality
   - Message persistence
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Additional accessibility enhancements

## Technical Implementation Details

1. **New Components**
   - `ConversationStarters`: Grid-based layout for starter prompts
   - `useScrollToBottom`: Custom hook for automatic scrolling

2. **Build Improvements**
   - Updated TypeScript configuration to exclude example directories

## Conclusion

The primary requirements for the hackathon submission have been met. The chat interface now provides a more polished and user-friendly experience with conversation starters and improved message handling. The core DocuSign functionality remains intact and secure.

Future iterations could focus on adding file attachment support and additional polish features, but these were deemed non-essential for the current release.

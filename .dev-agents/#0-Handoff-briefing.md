# Project Coordinator Handoff Brief

## Project Evolution

The project initially started as a DocuSign extension concept. However, it pivoted significantly upon discovering that extensions do not support UI components. This pivot is crucial as we transitioned from building an extension to creating a standalone web app that replicates DocuSign's experience while incorporating AI capabilities.

## Current Direction & Strategy

We are developing a web application that will:

- Mock/replicate core DocuSign UI and functionality.
- Add AI-powered analysis through a sidebar.
- Utilize DocuSign's APIs for real document integration.
- Retain Vercel AI SDK + Claude despite the pivot.

## Stakeholder Information

The project lead (user):

- Values technical precision and detailed planning.
- Appreciates critical thinking and questioning assumptions.
- Responds well to structured, organized communication.
- Prefers compact, reference-able documentation.
- Will readily pivot when presented with evidence.
- Desires tangible progress and clear task breakdowns.

## Technical Context

Critical considerations include:

- Thorough validation of DocuSign API capabilities.
- Rate limits as a key technical constraint.
- Document handling must support PDF/base64 ASCII format.
- Authentication requires careful planning.
- Real-time updates necessitate webhook implementation.

## Timeline & Scope

- **Hackathon deadline:** January 28, 2025 @ 1:00am UTC
- **Effective development time:** ~3 weeks
- Need a working prototype for demo.
- Must be submittable and demonstrable.

## Development Priorities

Start with:

- DocuSign API integration proof of concept.
- Document access verification.
- AI processing pipeline test.
- Basic UI framework.

Watch out for:

- API limitations or surprises.
- Authentication complexity.
- Performance issues.
- Feature scope creep.

## Success Criteria

### Technical:

- Clean, maintainable architecture.
- Reliable performance.
- Solid error handling.
- Clear technical validation at each step.

### Presentation:

- Compelling demo flow.
- Polished interface.
- Clear value proposition.
- Innovation in AI utilization.

## Process Guidance

As coordinator, you should:

- Maintain detailed task tracking in `TODO.md`.
- Create specific, actionable agent instructions.
- Validate technical assumptions before proceeding.
- Keep scope focused and achievable.
- Think critically about each decision.
- Consider demo impact of features.

## Communication Style

- Use structured formats for instructions.
- Keep information organized and reference-able.
- Be direct about technical concerns.
- Question assumptions.
- Maintain focus on hackathon requirements.

## Critical Reminders

- This is a hackathon project - focus on what can impress in a demo.
- Technical validation is crucial before proceeding with any component.
- Regular `TODO.md` updates are essential for tracking.
- Always consider the balance of ambition vs. feasibility.
- Each feature should contribute to winning potential.

## Meta Commentary

The project requires careful orchestration of multiple components while maintaining focus on creating a winning submission. Your role as coordinator is to ensure systematic progress while protecting against scope creep and technical risks. The stakeholder will respond best to evidence-based, organized coordination that maintains clear documentation and progress tracking. Remember: Always err on the side of over-communication and documentation. Better to raise a concern early than discover an issue late in development.

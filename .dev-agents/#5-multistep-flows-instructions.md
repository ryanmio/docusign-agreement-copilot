**TASK:** Implement Multi-Step Document Sending Flow

**OBJECTIVE:** Create the UI components and flow for sending a template to recipients through natural language commands, focusing on a simple but polished user experience that will impress hackathon judges.

**REQUIRED DELIVERABLES:**

1. Template Preview Component:
   - Create `components/template-preview.tsx`
   - Show template name, description, and preview
   - Display estimated signing time
   - Add "Proceed" and "Cancel" actions

2. Recipient Form Component:
   - Create `components/recipient-form.tsx`
   - Email and name input fields
   - Basic validation (email format)
   - Support for multiple recipients
   - "Send" and "Back" buttons

3. Send Confirmation Component:
   - Create `components/send-confirmation.tsx`
   - Show template and recipient summary
   - Display estimated completion time
   - "Confirm Send" and "Edit" buttons

4. AI Tool Integration:
   - Create `sendTemplate` tool in `ai/tools.ts`
   - Handle multi-step flow state
   - Support natural language recipient parsing
   - Add proper error handling

**EXAMPLE INTERACTIONS:**

User: "Send our standard NDA to alice@example.com"
AI: Shows template preview with recipient details and asks for confirmation

User: "Send the mutual NDA to Bob from Acme Corp"
AI: Shows preview, asks for Bob's email, then confirmation

**PROOF OF COMPLETION:**

Please provide:
1. Working components with proper styling
2. AI tool implementation
3. Example chat interactions
4. Updated documentation

**Next agent will handle:**
- Adding bulk document status checking
- Implementing reminder system
- Enhancing error handling
- Adding progress tracking

**IMPORTANT:**
- Keep the UI simple but polished
- Focus on the happy path first
- Maintain consistent styling
- Prioritize user experience 



# Handoff Report for Multi-Step Flows Implementation

Hi Agent 5! I've completed the foundational work for AI-driven UI components. Here's what's already in place:

## Completed Components & Tools

1. **Template Selector**
   - Component: `components/template-selector.tsx`
   - Tool Definition: `app/api/chat/route.ts` under `displayTemplateSelector`
   - Handles template listing, search, and selection
   - Already integrated with DocuSign API

2. **Envelope List**
   - Component: `components/envelope-list.tsx`
   - Tool Definition: `app/api/chat/route.ts` under `displayEnvelopeList`
   - Supports status filtering and pagination
   - Integrated with Supabase for data fetching

3. **Bulk Operations**
   - Component: `components/bulk-operation-view.tsx`
   - Tool Definition: `app/api/chat/route.ts` under `displayBulkOperation`
   - Real-time progress tracking via Supabase subscriptions

## Key Files

- **Chat Implementation**: `app/chat/page.tsx` - Contains all tool rendering logic
- **Tool Definitions**: `app/api/chat/route.ts` - All AI tools and system prompt
- **Types**: `types/envelopes.ts` - Contains all TypeScript interfaces
- **Documentation**: `docs/ai-components.md` - Detailed documentation of all components
- **DocuSign Integration**: `lib/docusign/envelopes.ts` - API client and methods

## Authentication Flow

- Authentication is handled through Supabase
- Each tool's `execute` function includes authentication checks
- Example pattern can be found in any of the existing tools

## Component Pattern

All components follow a consistent pattern:
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Responsive design
- TypeScript types
- Supabase/DocuSign integration

The chat interface is ready for your multi-step flow implementation. All the building blocks for template selection and recipient management are in place.

Good luck with the multi-step flows!

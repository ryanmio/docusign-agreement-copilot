# Request for Documentation: Multi-step Tool Implementation with Vercel AI SDK

## Current Status
We are experiencing challenges implementing interactive, multi-step tools in our DocuSign Agreement Copilot project. Specifically, we're having difficulty with:

1. Proper handling of form submissions in chat components
2. Managing tool state and completion
3. Coordinating between user interactions and AI responses

## Key Issues

### Form Component Integration
- Current implementation of `RecipientForm` shows multiple renders
- Unclear how to properly handle form submission results
- State management between form submission and AI response is inconsistent

### Tool Result Handling
- `addToolResult` behavior is not well documented
- Uncertainty about when/how to trigger AI continuation after user interaction
- Race conditions between tool results and chat state updates

## Documentation Needed

1. **Multi-step Tool Implementation**
   - Clear steps for implementing tools that require user interaction
   - Best practices for handling form state and submission
   - Examples of proper tool result handling

2. **Component Integration**
   - Guidelines for integrating React components as tools
   - Documentation on component lifecycle with AI chat flow
   - Examples of proper state management

3. **Chat Flow Control**
   - Documentation on controlling chat flow with user interactions
   - Guidelines for when to continue AI processing
   - Best practices for handling tool completion states

## Reference Implementation Requested
Please provide a reference implementation showing:
1. How to properly implement a multi-step tool
2. How to handle user input in components
3. How to manage tool state and completion
4. How to coordinate between user interactions and AI responses

## Next Steps
1. Review current Vercel AI SDK documentation
2. Provide updated implementation guidelines
3. Create example implementation of multi-step tool
4. Document best practices for our specific use case

## Impact
Without clear documentation and guidelines, we risk:
- Inconsistent user experience
- Race conditions in tool execution
- Unreliable chat flow
- Maintenance difficulties

Please assign an agent to review our implementation and provide comprehensive documentation for proper tool implementation with the Vercel AI SDK.

## References
- Current implementation in `app/chat/page.tsx`
- Vercel AI SDK documentation
- Request for demo information (#5-request-for-demo-info.md)

## Priority
High - This is blocking proper implementation of core features in our DocuSign Agreement Copilot project.

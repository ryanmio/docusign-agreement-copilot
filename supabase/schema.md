# Database Schema Documentation

### Overview
Our database provides essential infrastructure support for AI-powered DocuSign integrations. While the core AI functionality operates through direct API interactions with DocuSign, this schema handles critical supporting features like:
- User authentication and API credentials
- Real-time status tracking via DocuSign Connect webhooks
- Caching of expensive AI operations
- Audit trails and operation history

### Supporting Tables

#### Authentication & API Access
- **profiles**: Extends Supabase auth.users
  - Minimal user profile data
  - Links to DocuSign identity
  - Enables secure multi-user support

- **api_credentials**: OAuth token management
  - Securely stores DocuSign credentials
  - Enables continuous API access
  - Handles token refresh lifecycle

#### Status & Webhook Management
- **webhook_events**: Real-time DocuSign updates
  - Captures Connect webhook payloads
  - Enables real-time UI updates
  - Maintains audit trail

- **envelopes**: Envelope status tracking
  - Mirrors DocuSign envelope state
  - Updated via webhooks
  - Enables real-time progress monitoring

- **recipients**: Signing status tracking
  - Tracks individual signer progress
  - Stores signing URLs
  - Enables routing management

#### AI Operation Support
- **documents**: Document reference storage
  - Links to DocuSign envelopes
  - Tracks AI processing status
  - Caches document content when needed

- **analysis_results**: AI output caching
  - Stores reusable AI analysis
  - Reduces API costs
  - Enables quick retrieval

#### Batch Processing Support
- **bulk_operations**: Tracks mass operations
  - Monitors AI-driven bulk sends
  - Tracks success/error rates
  - Enables progress reporting

- **bulk_recipients**: Individual recipient tracking
  - Links to bulk operations
  - Stores individual outcomes
  - Enables detailed reporting

#### User Experience
- **user_preferences**: UI/UX settings
  - Theme preferences
  - Notification settings
  - AI behavior customization

### Security & Access
All tables implement row-level security (RLS) ensuring:
- Users only access their own data
- Webhook endpoints have required access
- AI operations maintain data isolation

### Extensions
Essential Postgres extensions:
- uuid-ossp: ID generation
- pgcrypto: Secure operations
- pgjwt: Token handling

### Note on AI Integration
This schema primarily supports the infrastructure around our AI operations. The core AI functionality:
- Makes direct API calls to DocuSign
- Uses real-time document analysis
- Operates independently of database
- Uses database only for caching and status tracking

The database serves as supporting infrastructure while the AI agents interact directly with DocuSign APIs to perform their core functions.

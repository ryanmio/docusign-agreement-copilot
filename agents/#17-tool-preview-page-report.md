# Tool Preview Page Implementation Report

## Overview
Successfully implemented a component preview page for the DocuSign Agreement Copilot project. The page showcases all available tools and components with their respective props, descriptions, and live examples.

## Implementation Details

### Directory Structure
- Created a route group `(preview)` with a dedicated preview route
- Implemented files:
  - `app/(preview)/preview/page.tsx`: Main preview page (client component)
  - `app/(preview)/preview/layout.tsx`: Layout wrapper (server component)
  - `lib/preview-data.ts`: Mock data for component examples

### Features
1. **Layout**
   - Clean, organized layout with DocuSign brand colors
   - Sticky header with title and description
   - White background container for content
   - Proper horizontal padding to prevent text from reaching screen edges

2. **Component Sections**
   - Each component displayed in a dedicated section
   - Clear title and description
   - Live example in a card container
   - Props documentation in a table format below each component
   - Horizontal dividers between sections using DocuSign's Mist color

3. **Components Showcased**
   - Loading States (with two variants)
   - Template Selector
   - Priority Dashboard
   - Template Preview
   - Recipient Form
   - PDF Viewer
   - Math Result
   - Bulk Operations List

### UI/UX Improvements
- Added proper spacing between loading state examples
- Converted props documentation to table format for better readability
- Implemented consistent padding and spacing throughout
- Used DocuSign's brand colors for visual consistency
- Added horizontal dividers for clear section separation

### Brand Consistency
- Used DocuSign's color palette:
  - Primary text: #130032
  - Secondary text: #130032 (70% opacity)
  - Accent color: #4C00FF
  - Background: #F8F3F0
  - Dividers: #CBC2FF (30% opacity)

## Future Considerations
1. Add more component variants to showcase different states
2. Include interactive examples with state management
3. Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for code snippets
4. Consider adding a search/filter functionality for components
5. Add responsive design considerations for mobile views

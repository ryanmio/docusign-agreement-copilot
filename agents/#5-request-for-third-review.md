# Implementation Update Report

## Context
Following your second review response, we have implemented the core tool state handling and performance improvements. We've made some adjustments to your recommendations based on testing and user experience considerations.

## Completed Implementation

### 1. Core Tool State Handling ✅
Successfully implemented with MVP focus:
- Added proper state handling (`partial-call`, `result`, `error`)
- Improved error handling with descriptive messages
- Added validation for required template preview props
- Simplified loading states for MVP
- Removed complex UI enhancements for post-MVP

Testing confirmed:
- Template selection and preview working smoothly
- Form validation and submission successful
- Back button navigation working as expected
- Error states properly displayed
- Loading states visible during transitions

### 2. Performance Improvements ✅ (with modifications)
Implemented with adjustments:

**Implemented as Recommended:**
- Added cleanup of old form states (30min expiry)
- Moved validation to separate utility module
- Added memoized form validation
- Improved code organization

**Modified from Original Recommendation:**
- Removed debouncing of state updates
  - Reason: The 100ms debounce caused noticeable typing lag in form inputs
  - Solution: Using direct state updates which provide better typing responsiveness
  - Impact: No negative performance impact observed with direct updates

### 3. Code Organization
New files created:
- `utils/validation.ts`: Centralized validation functions
- Enhanced `hooks/use-form-instance.ts` with cleanup and validation

## Testing Results
1. **Form Interaction**
   - Typing is responsive and accurate
   - Validation works instantly
   - No UI glitches observed

2. **State Management**
   - Form state updates correctly
   - Error handling works as expected
   - Loading states display appropriately

3. **Performance**
   - No noticeable lag in form interactions
   - Clean state management
   - Efficient validation

## Questions
1. Do you agree with our decision to remove debouncing given the typing performance issues?
2. Should we consider any alternative performance optimizations that won't impact typing responsiveness?
3. Are there any other MVP-critical improvements we should implement?

## Next Steps
We believe the implementation is now stable and provides a good balance of performance and user experience. Please review our changes and let us know if any adjustments are needed before proceeding with additional features.

**TASK:** Research and Implement In-Chat Document Signing Experience

**OBJECTIVE:** Research all available DocuSign signing options and implement the most user-friendly solution for signing documents directly through our chat interface, focusing on simplicity and wow-factor for the demo.

**RESEARCH AREAS:**

1. DocuSign Signing Options:
   - Embedded Signing API capabilities and requirements
   - Click API / Click-wrap solutions
   - PowerForms possibilities
   - SMS signing options
   - Any other innovative signing methods
   - Mobile SDK options if relevant

2. Integration Considerations:
   - Security requirements for each option
   - Authentication flow impacts
   - Mobile vs desktop experience
   - Browser compatibility
   - Session handling

3. User Experience Analysis:
   - Number of clicks to sign
   - Authentication friction
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Fallback options
   - Error scenarios

**REQUIRED DELIVERABLES:**

1. Options Analysis Document (`SIGNING-OPTIONS.md`):
   - Detailed breakdown of each signing method
   - Pros and cons for our use case
   - Implementation complexity assessment
   - Demo impact considerations
   - Clear recommendation with rationale

2. Implementation Plan:
   - Technical requirements
   - Authentication flow
   - UI component design
   - Error handling strategy
   - Fallback approach

3. AI Tool Integration:
   - Create `signDocument` tool
   - Handle authentication state
   - Manage signing session
   - Support multiple signing methods
   - Provide status updates

**PROOF OF COMPLETION:**

Provide:
1. Complete options analysis
2. Working signing implementation
3. AI tool integration
4. Example chat interactions
5. Error handling documentation

**IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:**

1. Demo Impact:
   - Which method will most impress judges?
   - How to demonstrate security without friction?
   - What's the "wow factor" potential?

2. User Experience:
   - Minimize clicks and friction
   - Handle mobile gracefully
   - Clear error messages
   - Smooth authentication

3. Technical Feasibility:
   - What can we reliably implement?
   - How to handle session state?
   - What are the security requirements?
   - How to manage callbacks?

4. Fallback Options:
   - What if embedded signing fails?
   - How to handle timeouts?
   - Browser compatibility issues?
   - Mobile fallback strategy?

**EXAMPLE INTERACTIONS TO CONSIDER:**

1. Happy Path:
   ```
   User: "Sign this document for me"
   AI: Renders signing interface directly in chat
   User: *Signs with minimal friction*
   AI: Confirms completion
   ```

2. Authentication Required:
   ```
   User: "Sign the vendor agreement"
   AI: Handles auth gracefully
   User: *Authenticates if needed*
   AI: Proceeds to signing
   ```

3. Error Handling:
   ```
   User: "Sign document"
   AI: Handles various error states elegantly
   User: Gets clear guidance on issues
   ```

**IMPORTANT:**
- Focus on demo impact
- Keep it simple but impressive
- Consider all signing options
- Plan for failures
- Think about mobile users
- Document everything clearly

Remember: The signing experience should feel magical - like the user is getting superpowers through the chat interface. Whether we embed directly or use clever shortcuts, it needs to wow the judges while being rock-solid reliable.

**TASK:** Research and Implement AI-Powered Document Generation with DocuSign

**OBJECTIVE:** Research the feasibility of allowing the AI agent to create and send complete DocuSign documents from scratch through natural language requests. If feasible, implement this capability.

**PHASE 1: Research & Feasibility Analysis**

1. Review Documentation:
   - DocuSign eSignature REST API docs
   - Template creation endpoints
   - Document generation capabilities
   - PDF manipulation options
   - Tabs/field placement APIs

2. Key Questions to Answer:
   - Can we programmatically create documents (not just use templates)?
   - Can we place signature fields and form fields programmatically?
   - What are the supported document formats?
   - Are there rate limits or restrictions?
   - What are the authentication requirements?

3. Proof of Concept Tests:
   - Test basic document creation
   - Test field placement
   - Test recipient assignment
   - Document limitations/restrictions

**DELIVERABLE 1: Feasibility Report**
```markdown
# DocuSign Document Generation Feasibility Report

## Executive Summary
[Can we implement AI-powered doc generation? Why/why not?]

## Technical Findings
- API Capabilities
- Limitations
- Authentication Requirements
- Rate Limits

## Implementation Path
[If feasible, outline the recommended approach]

## Risks & Mitigation
[Key challenges and how to address them]
```

**PHASE 2: Implementation (If Feasible)**

1. Core Implementation:
   - Create document generation service
   - Implement field placement logic
   - Add recipient management
   - Build document preview

2. AI Integration:
   - Create natural language interface
   - Add document type detection
   - Implement field extraction
   - Add validation checks

3. Example Interactions:
   ```typescript
   // Example of intended usage
   "Create an NDA for Acme Corp with standard confidentiality terms"
   "Draft a consulting agreement with rate of $150/hour"
   ```

**PROOF OF COMPLETION:**

If Feasible:
1. Working document generation
2. Example documents created
3. Integration with chat
4. Documentation
5. Test cases

If Not Feasible:
1. Detailed analysis report
2. Technical limitations
3. Alternative suggestions
4. Future possibilities

**IMPORTANT:**
- Focus on feasibility first
- Document all findings
- Consider user experience
- Think about error cases
- Keep security in mind

Remember: The goal is to determine if we can allow users to generate complete, signable documents through natural language requests. If feasible, implement it in a way that feels magical but reliable.

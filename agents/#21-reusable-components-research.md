**TASK:** Research and Plan Reusable DocuSign Agent Tools

**OBJECTIVE:** Analyze our existing components and the Stripe Agent Tools to create a detailed plan for building a reusable component library that other developers can use to build AI-powered DocuSign apps.

**RESEARCH AREAS:**

1. Stripe Agent Tools Analysis:
   - How do they structure their components?
   - What makes their tools reusable?
   - How do they handle configuration?
   - What's their developer experience like?
   - How do they document usage?

2. Agreement Copilot Component Audit:
   - Which components are most reusable?
   - What patterns are we using repeatedly?
   - Which features need to be configurable?
   - What dependencies can we eliminate?
   - How can we make the API simpler?

3. Developer Experience Research:
   - What would make our tools easy to use?
   - How should developers integrate our components?
   - What configuration options are needed?
   - How can we minimize setup friction?
   - What documentation is essential?

**DELIVERABLE:**

Create `#21-component-library-research-report.md` containing:

1. Stripe Tools Analysis:
   ```markdown
   ## Stripe Agent Tools Patterns
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Reusability patterns
   - Configuration approaches
   - Documentation structure
   ```

2. Component Recommendations:
   ```markdown
   ## Recommended Components
   
   ### Core Components
   1. DocuSignProvider
      - Purpose: Handle auth and context
      - Current implementation: [details]
      - Recommended changes: [list]
   
   2. TemplateSelector
      - Purpose: Browse and select templates
      - Current implementation: [details]
      - Recommended changes: [list]
   
   [etc...]
   ```

3. Implementation Plan:
   ```markdown
   ## Implementation Strategy
   
   1. Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
      - Set up package structure
      - Create base types
      - Implement context providers
   
   2. Phase 2: Basic Components
      - Extract authentication
      - Convert document tools
      - Package UI components
   
   3. Phase 3: AI Integration
      - Extract AI tools
      - Create helper functions
      - Document patterns
   ```

4. API Design:
   ```markdown
   ## Proposed API Design
   
   ```typescript
   // Example usage
   import { DocuSignProvider, useTemplates } from '@docusign/agent-tools';
   
   function App() {
     return (
       <DocuSignProvider config={...}>
         <YourApp />
       </DocuSignProvider>
     );
   }
   
   function TemplateList() {
     const { templates, select } = useTemplates();
     // ...
   }
   ```

5. Developer Experience:
   ```markdown
   ## Developer Experience
   
   1. Getting Started
      - Installation steps
      - Basic setup
      - First component
   
   2. Common Patterns
      - Authentication flow
      - Document handling
      - AI integration
   ```

**IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:**

1. Reusability:
   - How to make components truly reusable
   - What configuration is needed
   - How to handle different use cases

2. Developer Experience:
   - How to minimize setup friction
   - What documentation is needed
   - How to handle errors

3. Maintainability:
   - How to structure the package
   - What testing is needed
   - How to handle updates

**PROOF OF COMPLETION:**

Provide comprehensive research report covering:
1. Stripe Tools analysis
2. Component recommendations
3. Implementation strategy
4. API design examples
5. Developer experience plan

Remember: The goal is to create a clear plan for building tools that other developers will love using. Focus on what will make our components both powerful and easy to use.

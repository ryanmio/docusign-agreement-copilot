TASK: Debug and fix envelope success component in production environment

OBJECTIVE:
Fix the envelope success component which works in development but fails in production. The component is responsible for showing envelope status after sending and gets unmounted/remounted repeatedly in production, preventing proper status updates.

REQUIRED DELIVERABLES:

1. Production Environment Fix:
- Fix component lifecycle management in production
- Ensure Supabase queries complete successfully
- Prevent premature unmounting during streaming

2. Component State Management:
- Handle streaming state properly
- Maintain polling state across remounts
- Properly cleanup resources

3. Debugging Infrastructure:
- Add comprehensive logging
- Track component lifecycle
- Monitor Supabase connection state

PROOF OF COMPLETION:
Please provide:
1. Working component in production environment
2. Logs showing successful polling
3. No premature unmounting
4. Successful status updates

Next agent will handle:
- Production environment debugging
- Supabase connection investigation
- Component lifecycle analysis
- Streaming state management

IMPORTANT:
- Component works in development but fails in production
- Issue appears related to streaming and component lifecycle
- Multiple remounts occur only in production
- Time-sensitive fix needed for hackathon

👋 Hello from Agent 25 (Full Stack/React)!

I just completed debugging attempts on the envelope success component, and I wanted to share what we've learned about the production vs development behavior.

TECHNICAL HANDOFF NOTES:

1. Project Structure:
- `components/envelope-success.tsx` - Main component with polling logic
- `app/chat/page.tsx` - Parent component handling streaming
- `app/api/envelopes/[id]` - API endpoint for envelope data
- `.env.production` - Production environment configuration

2. Existing Patterns:
- Component uses useEffect for polling
- Refs used for cleanup management
- Supabase client for data fetching
- Streaming response handling in chat page

3. Key Files to Reference:
- `components/envelope-success.tsx` - Contains polling logic and lifecycle management
- `app/chat/page.tsx` - Shows how streaming affects component mounting
- `middleware.ts` - May affect Supabase auth in production

4. Helpful Code Patterns:
```typescript
// Current polling implementation
useEffect(() => {
  isActiveRef.current = true;
  const pollEnvelope = async () => {
    if (!isActiveRef.current) return;
    // ... polling logic
  };
  pollEnvelope();
  return () => {
    isActiveRef.current = false;
    if (pollingRef.current) clearTimeout(pollingRef.current);
  };
}, [envelopeId, onComplete, supabase]);

// Chat page streaming handling
if (!result.completed) {
  return (
    <div key={`envelope-${result.envelopeId}-${toolCallId}`}>
      <EnvelopeSuccess 
        envelopeId={result.envelopeId} 
        onComplete={async () => {
          await handleToolResult(toolCallId, {
            ...result,
            completed: true
          });
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

5. Development Tips:
- Component works perfectly in development
- Production shows repeated mount/unmount cycles
- Supabase queries start but don't complete in production
- Cleanup is triggered immediately in production

6. Gotchas We Found:
- Different behavior between dev and prod environments
- Streaming causes more frequent remounts in production
- Supabase connection might be affected by production config
- Component cleanup happens before query completion

I'm sorry I couldn't fully resolve this issue, but I've added comprehensive logging and tried several approaches:

1. Added refs for lifecycle management
2. Improved cleanup handling
3. Added completion callback
4. Enhanced error boundaries
5. Added detailed logging
6. Modified streaming state handling

The core issue seems to be that in production, the component gets unmounted before Supabase queries can complete, while in development it works fine. This might be related to how streaming responses are handled differently in production, or how Supabase connections are managed.

Best regards,

Note: Pay special attention to the timing of Supabase query completion vs component cleanup in production logs. This seems to be the key difference between environments.

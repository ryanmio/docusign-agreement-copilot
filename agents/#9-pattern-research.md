**TASK:** Research and Plan Pattern Recognition Strategy for Agreement Management

**OBJECTIVE:** Design a simple but effective approach to recognize and display user patterns (like "Tuesday Review") that will support the demo narrative of AI understanding and automating regular tasks. Focus on achievable patterns we can implement with our existing data.

**RESEARCH AREAS:**

1. Available Data Analysis:
   - What patterns can we realistically detect from our existing Supabase tables?
   - Which DocuSign API endpoints give us useful pattern data?
   - What metadata can we use for pattern detection?

2. Pattern Types to Consider:
   - Time-based patterns (e.g., "Tuesday Review")
   - Template usage patterns
   - Recipient patterns
   - Document type patterns

3. Implementation Feasibility:
   - Which patterns can we reliably detect?
   - What's the minimum data needed for each pattern?
   - How can we "seed" realistic patterns for the demo?

**REQUIRED DELIVERABLES:**

1. Pattern Detection Strategy:
   - List of specific patterns we can detect
   - Data requirements for each pattern
   - Detection logic outline
   - Confidence scoring approach

2. Demo Data Requirements:
   - What historical data needs to be seeded
   - How to structure the data
   - Timeline for pattern emergence

3. Technical Implementation Plan:
   - Recommended database queries
   - Data processing approach
   - Pattern storage strategy
   - Update frequency

**PROOF OF COMPLETION:**

Provide:
1. `PATTERN-DETECTION-PLAN.md` with:
   - Detailed pattern detection strategy
   - Data requirements and structure
   - Implementation recommendations
   - Demo considerations

**IMPORTANT:**
- Keep it simple - we only need enough for a convincing demo
- Focus on patterns we can reliably detect
- Consider what will impress judges
- Think about what data we can realistically gather
- Remember this is for a hackathon demo

Remember: We need this research to help Agent 10 implement the Pattern Recognition Display component effectively. Focus on what's achievable with our current infrastructure.

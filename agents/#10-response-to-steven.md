Hi Steven,

Thank you for looking into the eSign -> Navigator sync exception. 

Our hackathon project focuses on using Navigator's AI capabilities to help users better manage their agreements. We have several test agreements already set up in eSign (vendor renewals and employee documents) that we'd like Navigator's AI to analyze for our demo.

The sync would help us avoid manually recreating these documents and let us focus on building out the integration with Navigator's AI insights API.

Let me know if you need any additional details about our use case.

Best regards,
Ryan

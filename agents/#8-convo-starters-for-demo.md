   - Update any related types/interfaces
   - Test all changes

3. Testing Evidence:
   - Sample AI responses for each starter
   - Screenshot before/after
   - Performance impact check

PROOF OF COMPLETION:
1. Updated code files
2. Test results for each starter
3. Sample AI responses
4. Brief implementation report

Next agent will handle:
- Any UI adjustments needed
- Additional starter suggestions
- Error case handling

# Agreement Copilot Demo Script

Below is a cinematic-style script to guide the recording of our demo video for Agreement Copilot. The story features Rachel, who must cover for Tom (or Mark) unexpectedly, and shows how the system guides her through her daily contract operations.

---

## Scene 1: The Unexpected Message

1. Visual: iMessage (or any chat UI) overlay appears on screen.
2. Text pop-up from "Tom":  
   > “Hey Rachel, I’m out unexpectedly. We have vendor renewals and legal requests due today. Can you handle it?”

3. Narrator (voice-over or text subtitle):
   > “When Rachel finds herself covering for Tom without warning, she turns to DocuSign’s new Agreement Copilot.”

4. Transition: The scene fades into Rachel’s computer screen, showing Agreement Copilot’s chat interface.

## Scene 2: Morning Priorities

1. Rachel speaks (or types into the chat):
   > “Copilot, what are today’s urgent priorities?”

2. Narrator:
   > “With a single prompt, Agreement Copilot intelligently retrieves pending tasks and deadlines from DocuSign.”

3. Screen Action:
   - The chat displays an AI response:  
     > “There are three urgent items: two vendor renewals expiring in 3 days, and an offboarding document required for Sarah in Engineering.”

    - Simultaneously, the relevant UI components appear (e.g., EnvelopeList) summarizing the pending agreements, showing due dates, and priority levels.

## Scene 3: Bulk Contract Renewals

1. Rachel says:
   > “Can you help me renew these vendor contracts?”

2. Narrator:
   > “Copilot uses DocuSign’s bulk send feature and a pre-configured template with a standard 5% price increase that Tom normally applies.”

3. Screen Action:
   - The chat interface offers a quick summary:  
     > “I see 2 vendor agreements set to expire. Would you like me to apply a 5% increase and use the ‘Vendor Renewal’ template?”

   - Rachel confirms:  
     > “Yes. Let’s do that.”

   - We see a “BulkOperationView” component appear:
     - Real-time status updates for each renewal envelope being sent.  
     - Progress bar advanced as each contract is emailed out.

## Scene 4: Pattern Recognition & Routines

1. Rachel asks:
   > “Copilot, what does Tom usually do on Tuesdays?”

2. Narrator:
   > “Agreement Copilot recognizes Tom’s routine patterns: checking new agreements, compiling a weekly legal report, and following up with any unsigned documents.”

3. Screen Action:
   - The AI chat displays:
     > “Tom typically reviews 2 new vendor agreements, prepares a summary, and schedules follow-ups. Would you like me to start the process?”

   - Rachel replies:
     > “Yes, please prepare a quick summary for the legal team.”

   - The system automatically gathers the relevant details, and a “DocumentDetails” or “PDFViewer” component opens for Rachel’s review.

## Scene 5: Employee Offboarding

1. Rachel says:
   > “Sarah from Engineering is leaving. Show me what needs to be handled.”

2. Narrator:
   > “By pulling from DocuSign’s envelopes and user roles, Agreement Copilot identifies all relevant NDAs, IP clauses, and transfer documents for Sarah.”

3. Screen Action:
   - The AI chat reveals a list:
     > “Found 1 active NDA, 1 IP agreement, and 3 vendor accounts under Sarah’s name. I can generate offboarding documents. Would you like me to proceed?”

   - Rachel agrees:
     > “Yes—let’s finalize the offboarding documents.”

   - The system updates the chat with a link to the newly prepared forms, prompting Rachel to review, sign, or send for signature.

---

## Scene 6: Proactive Insights & Automation

1. Narrator:
   > “Not only does Agreement Copilot react, it also anticipates upcoming deadlines.”

2. Screen Action:
   - The chat proactively notifies:
     > “I noticed a quarterly vendor review is due next week, and you have 3 pending countersignatures. Would you like help scheduling or reminding them?”

3. Rachel replies:
   > “Yes, please send reminders.”

   - The system queues up “envelope reminder” actions in real time, again showcasing how tasks can be automated with minimal user effort.

## Scene 7: Conclusion & Wrap-Up

1. Rachel addresses the camera (or final voice-over text):
   > “I handled Tom’s entire workload seamlessly, thanks to Agreement Copilot. It’s like having our legal ops lead right here, guiding me.”

2. Narrator final commentary:
   > “From vendor renewals to offboarding tasks, Agreement Copilot empowers anyone to manage DocuSign agreements effortlessly. The result? Business continuity—no matter who’s away.”

3. Closing screen:
   - Agreement Copilot + DocuSign logos fade into view.
   - A short mention: “Built for the DocuSign Hackathon—where AI meets Agreements.”

## Runtime Notes & Tips

1. Aim for a total video length of approximately 5 minutes:
   - Keep each scene’s dialogue succinct so there’s time for visuals.
2. Use subtitles or on-screen text to reinforce key features (e.g., “BulkOperationView,” “DocumentDetails,” “Offboarding Template,” etc.).
3. Focus on showing the chat’s intelligence and real-time UI updates:
   - Insert short screencasts of the “envelope list,” “document previews,” or “bulk send progress.”
4. Ensure the final scene references the hackathon’s theme of bridging the “Agreement Trap.”

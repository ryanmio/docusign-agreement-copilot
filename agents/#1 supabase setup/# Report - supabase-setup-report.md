# Supabase Setup Specialist Report

## Overview
This report documents the completion of Supabase infrastructure setup for the Agreement Copilot project, including database schema, authentication, and security policies.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Infrastructure
- ✅ Supabase project created and configured
- ✅ Environment variables set up in `.env.local`
- ✅ Connection verified and tested

### 2. Database Schema Implementation
All required tables have been created with appropriate relationships and constraints:

#### Core Tables
- `profiles` - Extends auth.users with additional user information
  - Links to Supabase Auth via `auth.users`
  - Stores basic user profile data
  
- `documents` - Main documents storage
  - UUID primary key
  - Links to user profiles
  - Stores DocuSign envelope IDs
  - Tracks document status via custom enum
  
- `analysis_results` - AI analysis storage
  - Links to documents
  - Stores analysis summaries and structured data
  - JSON support for flexible data storage

#### Supporting Tables
- `user_preferences` - User-specific settings
  - Theme preferences
  - Notification settings
  - Timestamps for tracking changes

- `api_credentials` - Secure OAuth storage
  - DocuSign integration support
  - Secure token storage
  - Automatic timestamp tracking

### 3. Security Implementation
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- ✅ User-specific access policies configured
- ✅ Secure credential storage implemented

#### Security Policies
Each table has specific policies ensuring users can only:
- Access their own profile data
- Manage their own documents
- View analysis results for their documents
- Control their preferences
- Manage their API credentials

### 4. Authentication
- ✅ Google authentication provider configured
- ✅ Auth UI implemented
- ✅ Session management setup complete

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
The schema uses:
- UUID for primary keys
- Timestamp tracking on all tables
- Foreign key constraints for referential integrity
- Custom enums for status tracking
- JSONB for flexible data storage

## Conclusion
The Supabase infrastructure is now fully configured and ready for the Agreement Copilot application. The foundation is secure, scalable, and follows best practices for data management and user security.

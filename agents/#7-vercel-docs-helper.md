# Vercel AI SDK Documentation Helper

**CONTEXT:** 
We are currently struggling with implementing the `RecipientForm` component in our chat interface. Specific issues include:
- Multiple renders of the form component
- Unclear handling of form submission data
- Race conditions between form submission and AI processing
- Uncertainty about when to trigger AI continuation
- Form state persistence across chat messages

**TASK:** Create Comprehensive Documentation for Multi-step Tool Implementation with Vercel AI SDK

**OBJECTIVE:** Systematically review all Vercel AI SDK documentation and cookbook examples to create clear, actionable documentation for implementing multi-step tools in our chat interface, with special focus on form handling and state management.

**SPECIFIC CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS:**

1. Form Component Lifecycle:
   - When exactly should the form component be rendered?
   - How to prevent multiple renders of the same form?
   - How to handle form state across chat messages?

2. Tool Result Flow:
   - When should `addToolResult` be called?
   - How to properly structure tool results?
   - How to signal completion to the AI?

3. AI Continuation:
   - When should the AI continue processing?
   - How to pass form data to the next AI step?
   - How to handle back/cancel actions?

4. State Management:
   - How to track form completion state?
   - How to persist form data between renders?
   - How to handle partial form submissions?

**PROCESS:**

1. Documentation Review Planning:
   - Create `#7-vercel-doc-notes.md`
   - First section should be "Documentation Review Plan"
   - List all available docs and cookbook examples
   - Create systematic review order
   - Note specific questions to answer in each doc
   - Outline note-taking structure

2. Systematic Documentation Review:
   - Review each document in planned order
   - Take detailed notes in `#7-vercel-doc-notes.md`
   - Focus areas for each doc:
     - Multi-step tool implementation patterns
     - Form handling best practices
     - State management approaches
     - Chat flow control
     - Component integration methods

3. Create Final Documentation:
   - Create `#7-vercel-doc-report.md` with:
     - Clear implementation patterns
     - Step-by-step guides
     - Code examples
     - Best practices
     - Common pitfalls
     - Troubleshooting guide

**REQUIRED DELIVERABLES:**

1. `#7-vercel-doc-notes.md`:
   - Documentation review plan
   - Systematic notes from each document
   - Key findings and patterns
   - Questions and clarifications
   - Implementation insights

2. `#7-vercel-doc-report.md`:
   - Multi-step Tool Implementation Guide
     - Tool definition patterns
     - Form component integration
     - State management
     - Chat flow control
   - Best Practices
     - Component lifecycle
     - Error handling
     - Race condition prevention
   - Example Implementations
     - Basic multi-step tool
     - Form handling
     - Tool completion
   - Troubleshooting Guide
     - Common issues
     - Solutions
     - Debug strategies

**KEY AREAS TO RESEARCH:**

1. Tool Implementation:
   - How to define multi-step tools
   - Tool state management
   - Completion handling
   - Error scenarios
   - Back/cancel action handling

2. Form Integration:
   - Form component lifecycle
   - State management
   - Submission handling
   - AI response coordination
   - Multiple render prevention

3. Chat Flow:
   - Flow control methods
   - User interaction handling
   - AI response management
   - State persistence
   - Message threading

4. Component Integration:
   - Component rendering in chat
   - State management
   - Lifecycle handling
   - Error boundaries
   - Re-render prevention

**EXAMPLE SCENARIOS TO DOCUMENT:**

1. Basic Form Flow:
   ```typescript
   // Show how the form should be rendered
   // Show how form submission should work
   // Show how to pass data back to AI
   ```

2. Back/Cancel Actions:
   ```typescript
   // Show how to handle navigation
   // Show how to maintain state
   // Show how to resume AI flow
   ```

3. Error Handling:
   ```typescript
   // Show how to handle validation errors
   // Show how to handle submission errors
   // Show how to recover from errors
   ```

**PROOF OF COMPLETION:**

Provide:
1. Complete documentation review plan
2. Detailed notes from each document
3. Comprehensive implementation guide
4. Working code examples
5. Troubleshooting guide

**IMPORTANT:**
- Be systematic in documentation review
- Take detailed notes
- Focus on practical implementation
- Include working code examples
- Document common pitfalls
- Create clear, actionable guides
- Address our specific RecipientForm challenges

Remember: The goal is to create documentation that will solve our current implementation challenges and make multi-step tool implementation clear and maintainable for our team.

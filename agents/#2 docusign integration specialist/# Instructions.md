4. Implement webhook listeners ✅
5. Create document processing pipeline ✅

## Technical Requirements
1. OAuth Implementation: ✅
   - Authorization code grant flow
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Secure credential storage in Supabase
   - Error handling and recovery

2. API Integration: ✅
   - Envelope CRUD operations
   - Document retrieval system
   - Webhook event handling
   - Rate limit management

## Task List (Remaining Implementation Items)
1. Template Management: ✅
   - [x] List available templates endpoint
   - [x] Create envelope from template endpoint
   - [x] Template role management
   - [x] Template creation/modification API

2. Document Correction:
   - [ ] Update draft documents endpoint
   - [ ] Modify recipient information
   - [ ] Update signing order
   - [ ] Access code/authentication updates

3. Advanced Recipient Types:
   - [ ] Carbon copy recipients
   - [ ] Certified delivery
   - [ ] In-person signers
   - [ ] Witness support

4. Bulk Operations:
   - [ ] Bulk send endpoint
   - [ ] Batch status updates
   - [ ] Bulk recipient management
   - [ ] Mass void/correction support

5. Enhanced Document Download:
   - [ ] Combined document download
   - [ ] Certificate of completion
   - [ ] Audit trail retrieval
   - [ ] Evidence summary

6. Envelope Correction:
   - [ ] Update recipient endpoint
   - [ ] Modify routing order
   - [ ] Update notification settings
   - [ ] Correct signing settings

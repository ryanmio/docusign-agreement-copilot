**TASK:** Generate and Deploy Demo Documents for eSignature and Navigator Integration

**OBJECTIVE:** Create and deploy a complete set of realistic test documents that demonstrate our key demo scenarios in both DocuSign eSignature and Navigator, ensuring proper AI analysis and pattern detection.

**REQUIRED DELIVERABLES:**

1. Document Generation:
   - Create all 15-20 required documents following the demo script:
     - 8 Tuesday pattern documents (weekly reviews, summaries)
     - 4 vendor renewals with varying expiration dates
     - 3 Sarah's offboarding documents
     - 2-3 additional agreement types
     - 1-2 quarterly review documents
   - Each document must include:
     - Proper metadata for Navigator AI
     - Realistic dates and terms
     - Consistent party names
     - Standard clauses

2. eSignature Deployment Package:
   - Bulk Send CSV template
   - Document templates
   - Recipient mapping
   - Envelope custom fields for filtering
   - Status completion plan

3. Navigator Sync Configuration:
   - Sync filter settings
   - Document categorization rules
   - AI analysis verification checklist
   - Pattern detection test cases

**DEPLOYMENT PROCESS:**

1. Document Creation (Day 1-2):
   - Generate base templates
   - Add required metadata
   - Include standard clauses
   - Set up proper dates

2. eSignature Upload (Day 3):
   - Prepare Bulk Send package
   - Execute bulk upload
   - Complete/sign documents
   - Verify envelope statuses

3. Navigator Sync (Day 4-5):
   - Configure sync filters
   - Monitor AI processing
   - Verify pattern detection
   - Test search capabilities

4. Verification (Day 6):
   - Test all demo scenarios
   - Verify AI insights
   - Confirm patterns
   - Document any issues

**CRITICAL PATTERNS TO VERIFY:**

1. Tuesday Patterns:
   - Weekly review documents
   - Internal summaries
   - Vendor check-ins
   - Must span multiple weeks

2. Vendor Renewals:
   - Mix of expiration dates
   - Auto-renewal terms
   - Standard clauses
   - Payment terms

3. Sarah's Offboarding:
   - Connected documents
   - Clear relationships
   - Proper assignments
   - Timeline alignment

**PROOF OF COMPLETION:**

Provide:
1. Complete document package
2. Bulk Send configuration
3. Navigator sync settings
4. Pattern verification report
5. Demo readiness checklist

**IMPORTANT:**
- Follow the two-step process (eSignature then Navigator)
- Ensure consistent metadata across documents
- Allow time for AI processing
- Test all demo scenarios
- Keep document count under Navigator limits
- Document any fallback options

Remember: These documents are the foundation of our demo. They must reliably demonstrate all features while supporting our narrative of AI-powered agreement management.

TASK: Debug and Enhance Navigator API Query Construction

OBJECTIVE:
Analyze and improve how the chatbot constructs Navigator API queries to ensure all filtering criteria (party names, categories, types, etc.) are properly applied. Focus on fixing the discrepancy between the API's capabilities and our current implementation.

REQUIRED DELIVERABLES:

1. API Call Analysis:
- Audit current query construction in `app/api/navigator/analyze/route.ts`
- Document how filters are being constructed and passed
- Identify gaps between available filters and implemented filters
- Map user natural language queries to API parameters

2. Filter Implementation Audit:
- Review filter handling in `components/navigator-analysis.tsx`
- Document which filters are working vs non-functional
- Analyze filter state management
- Test filter combinations and edge cases

3. Query Construction Enhancement:
- Improve query parameter mapping
- Add support for missing filter types
- Implement proper filter validation
- Add filter combination logic

4. Testing & Validation:
- Create test scenarios for each filter type
- Document expected vs actual results
- Provide example queries that should work
- Create validation checklist

PROOF OF COMPLETION:
Please provide:
1. Detailed analysis of current API call construction
2. List of identified issues and their root causes
3. Implementation recommendations with code examples
4. Test cases and validation results

Next agent will handle:
- Implementation of enhanced filter support
- UI improvements for filter feedback
- Error handling improvements
- Performance optimization

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on the query construction logic, not UI changes
- Document any API limitations discovered
- Consider rate limiting and performance
- Maintain existing error handling patterns

üëã Hello from Agent 10 (Navigator API Expert)!

I've been working on the Navigator API integration, and we've discovered some issues with how filters are being applied. Here's what I've learned about our project structure and patterns that will help with your analysis:

1. Project Structure:
- `app/api/navigator/analyze/route.ts` - Main API endpoint for Navigator analysis
- `components/navigator-analysis.tsx` - Frontend component handling filters
- `lib/docusign/navigator-client.ts` - Navigator API client implementation
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Contains chatbot logic for constructing queries

2. Existing Patterns:
- Natural language queries are parsed in chat route
- Filters are constructed in navigator/analyze route
- API calls are made through NavigatorClient class
- Results are displayed in NavigatorAnalysis component

3. Key Files to Reference:
- `app/api/navigator/analyze/route.ts` - Shows current filter construction
- `lib/docusign/navigator-client.ts` - Shows available API parameters
- `components/navigator-analysis.tsx` - Shows filter UI implementation
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Shows natural language processing

4. Helpful Code Patterns:
```typescript
// Current filter construction in analyze route
const options: {
  from_date?: string;
  to_date?: string;
  agreement_type?: string;
} = {};

// Filter application in NavigatorClient
async getAgreements(userId: string, options?: {
  from_date?: string;
  to_date?: string;
  agreement_type?: string;
}) {
  // API call construction
}

// Natural language processing in chat route
if (query.toLowerCase().includes('last 6 months')) {
  options.from_date = sixMonthsAgo.toISOString();
  options.to_date = new Date().toISOString();
}
```

5. Development Tips:
- Use Navigator API debug endpoint for testing
- Check API response structure for available filters
- Test filter combinations systematically
- Log all API calls and responses

6. Gotchas We Found:
- Party name filtering happens post-API call
- Some filters aren't passed to the API
- Date range detection is limited
- Filter combinations may not work as expected

I'm excited to see how you improve the query construction! The main issue seems to be that we're not properly mapping all available filters to the API calls, and some filtering is happening client-side when it could be done server-side.

Best regards,

Note: The Navigator API supports more filter types than we're currently using. The challenge is properly mapping natural language queries to these filters and ensuring they're correctly passed through the entire stack.

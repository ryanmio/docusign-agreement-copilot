   - Built recipient form collection and validation
   - Created envelope sending with status tracking
   - Established context-aware conversation handling

2. **DocuSign Integration**
   - Successfully integrated template selection and preview
   - Implemented envelope creation and sending
   - Added recipient management functionality
   - Set up webhook handling for status updates

3. **Chat Intelligence**
   - Developed context-aware response system
   - Implemented step-by-step guidance
   - Added error handling and recovery
   - Created natural conversation flow

4. **Tool Integration**
   - Built template preview tool
   - Implemented recipient collection tool
   - Created envelope sending tool
   - Added status tracking capabilities

## Request for Demo Plan

We request a `DEMO-PLAN.md` file that includes:

1. **Demo Scenario Details**
   - Specific use case leveraging our multi-step capabilities
   - Context and background for the scenario
   - Expected outcome highlighting our key features

2. **Step-by-Step Flow**
   - Exact conversation flow with the AI agent
   - Key decision points and agent responses
   - Expected template and recipient handling
   - Status tracking and webhook demonstrations

3. **Feature Showcase Requirements**
   - Which multi-step capabilities to highlight
   - How to demonstrate context awareness
   - Key integration points to showcase
   - Error scenarios to handle (if any)

4. **Technical Requirements**
   - Specific webhook events to demonstrate
   - Required response timings
   - Any specific UI interactions to highlight

## Why This Is Important

1. **Feature Highlighting**
   - Showcase our most impressive capabilities
   - Demonstrate the power of multi-step actions
   - Show the natural conversation flow

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Test complete user journeys
   - Ensure smooth transitions between steps
   - Prepare for various interaction paths

3. **Time Management**
   - Focus on most impactful features
   - Optimize demo flow for time constraints
   - Prepare concise but powerful demonstrations

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**
   - Await demo plan details
   - Continue refining multi-step actions
   - Enhance status tracking capabilities

2. **Upon Receiving Plan**
   - Optimize conversation flows for demo
   - Fine-tune response timing
   - Create targeted test scenarios

3. **Pre-Demo**
   - Run through complete multi-step flows
   - Test webhook responsiveness
   - Prepare backup plans if needed

## Questions for Consideration

1. Which multi-step capabilities should we emphasize?
2. How should we demonstrate the AI's context awareness?
3. What complex scenarios should we prepare for?
4. How much time is allocated for the demo?
5. Should we prepare for live modifications to the flow?

## Recommendations

1. Include complex scenarios in the demo plan
2. Specify timing for multi-step actions
3. Identify potential webhook timing issues
4. List required test envelopes and templates
5. Outline fallback options for each step

We believe having this detailed demo plan will help us showcase our sophisticated multi-step agent capabilities and create the most impressive demonstration possible for the hackathon.

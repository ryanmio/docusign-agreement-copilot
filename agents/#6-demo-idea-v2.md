## 2. Demo Narrative Flow

The demo is centered on Rachel, who unexpectedly fills in for Mark—the legal ops lead. The storyline highlights how Agreement Copilot’s context-aware AI and DocuSign integration guide her through Mark’s daily tasks.

### 2.1 Step 0: Introduction (15 seconds)

1. Show a quick background screen or image:  
   “Mark, the Legal Operations lead, is out for an emergency. Rachel, an Operations Manager with minimal legal ops experience, must handle all the day’s contract issues. Agreement Copilot is here to help.”

2. Key Points:  
   - Aligns with the hackathon’s user empathy approach.  
   - Demonstrates the “Potential Impact” criteria: bridging skill gaps quickly.

### 2.2 Step 1: “Morning Scramble” – Checking Urgent Priorities (30 seconds)

1. Rachel opens Agreement Copilot and says:  
   “What are the urgent priorities for today?”  
2. Technical Explanation:  
   - The AI Chat interface (Context-Aware Chat Interface) is triggered with a natural language prompt.  
   - The backend queries “historical patterns” to find top priority tasks.  
3. Live Demo Element:  
   - The AI interprets and responds by calling the “displayEnvelopeList” tool.  
   - This uses supabase and DocuSign data to filter envelopes near deadlines.  

   Example Chatbot Interaction:  
   ```
   User (Rachel): "What are the urgent priorities for today?"
   Copilot internally calls: displayEnvelopeList({ status: 'sent', showStatusFilter: false })
   Copilot (AI): "Here are the agreements requiring immediate attention: [Vendor Renewal #1, Vendor Renewal #2, Offboarding Document for Sarah, etc.]"
   ```
4. Judging Criteria Alignment:  
   - Technical Implementation: Real-time data fetch + AI-coded conversation.  
   - Design: Easy-to-read priority list.  
   - Potential Impact: Instant clarity on time-sensitive tasks.

### 2.3 Step 2: “Handling Routine Tasks” – Bulk Vendor Renewals (1 minute)

1. Rachel sees 3 vendor renewal envelopes are about to expire. She instructs Copilot:  
   “Can you help me renew these vendor contracts?”  
2. Technical Explanation:  
   - The AI references “pattern recognition” to see Mark typically uses a 5% price increase and a certain template.  
   - The user sees a prompt in the chat that asks if they want to proceed with the Bulk Renewal.  
3. Live Demo Element:  
   - Copilot calls `TemplateSelector` (if needed) or directly picks the common renewal template.  
   - Then calls `displayBulkOperation` to demonstrate the envelope-sending process.  

   Example Chatbot Interaction:
   ```
   User (Rachel): "Renew these vendor contracts."
   Copilot: "Sure. Mark usually applies a 5% increase. Shall I prepare the documents?"
   ```
   - After user confirmation, it triggers the `BulkOperationView`, which tracks progress for each vendor.  
4. Judging Criteria Alignment:  
   - Technical Implementation: Bulk send integration with DocuSign (webhooks to track sending status).  
   - Design: BulkOperationView with progress bars and real-time feedback.  
   - Potential Impact: Saves hours of manual labor.  
   - Quality of Idea: Showcases advanced synergy between AI, user patterns, and DocuSign.

### 2.4 Step 3: Learning Mark’s Patterns – The Tuesday Review (1 minute)

1. Rachel asks: “What does Mark usually do on Tuesdays?”  
2. Technical Explanation:  
   - The AI leverages “Historical Patterns” to respond with Mark’s routine tasks:
     1. Summarizing new vendor agreements,  
     2. Generating a legal team report,  
     3. Following up on unsigned documents.  
3. Live Demo Element:  
   - Once the user says “Yes, help me prepare,” the Copilot calls a hypothetical `DocumentDetails` tool (or similar) that fetches the relevant docs to highlight.  
   - The AI might open a PDF preview (using `displayPdfViewer`) for a recent vendor doc.  
4. Judging Criteria Alignment:  
   - Quality of Idea: Role-based patterns reduce training time.  
   - Technical Implementation: Automated scanning of incomplete docs.  
   - Potential Impact: Institutional knowledge continuity.

### 2.5 Step 4: Employee Transition – Offboarding Sarah (1 minute)

1. Rachel says: “Sarah from Engineering is leaving. Show me what needs to be done.”  
2. Technical Explanation:  
   - The AI quickly finds NDAs, IP docs, or vendor accounts assigned to Sarah.  
   - Suggests a pre-built offboarding template or new documents to handle the transition.  
3. Live Demo Element:  
   - Copilot calls `displayDocumentDetails({ envelopeId: ... })` to show NDAs or IP docs needing closure.  
   - Possibly triggers `displayPdfViewer` for the user to review final forms or sign off on a handover.  
4. Judging Criteria Alignment:  
   - Technical Implementation: Using envelope data from Supabase and DocuSign to identify incomplete transitions.  
   - Design: Clear calls to action for the user.  
   - Potential Impact: Minimizes compliance risks, ensures continuity.

### 2.6 Step 5: Proactive Support – Pattern Recognition & Automation (1 minute)

1. Copilot proactively mentions:  
   “I see the quarterly vendor review is coming up, and there are updates needed for the new policy. Would you like me to start prepping them?”  
2. Technical Explanation:  
   - The system checks upcoming deadlines from historical data and user patterns.  
   - Demonstrates advanced AI triggers: not just reacting but proactively suggesting tasks.  
3. Live Demo Element:  
   - The AI might display a summary of tasks with quick UI checks: “Approve,” “Schedule,” or “Mark as Done.”  
   - Could show `EnvelopeList` with a special filter for ‘awaiting counter-sign’ or ‘policy updates needed.’  
4. Judging Criteria Alignment:  
   - Quality of Idea: Predictive capability and strong alignment with business processes.  
   - Potential Impact: Saves time, prevents missed tasks, and reduces error rates.

### 2.7 Step 6: Closing the Day – Final Recap (30 seconds)

1. Rachel: “I never thought I could handle this without Mark’s expertise. Agreement Copilot guided me, ensuring nothing slipped through the cracks.”  
2. Key Points:  
   - Summarize the day’s tasks, show that everything is done without specialized knowledge.  
   - Show that the system is user-friendly and fosters independence.

**TASK:** Research DocuSign Navigator Reporting API Integration

**OBJECTIVE:** Investigate the Navigator reporting API to replicate AI-powered charts and analytics in our app, focusing on the agreement reports endpoint you found.

**RESEARCH AREAS:**

1. API Investigation:
   ```
   Base URL: https://apps-d.docusign.com/api/proxy-us-s1/reporting-adhoc-queries-ipr/v1.0
   Endpoint: /accounts/{accountId}/agreementReports
   ```

2. Required Data Points:
   - Authentication requirements
   - Request parameters
   - Response format
   - Rate limits
   - Available metrics

3. Chart Types to Replicate:
   - Active agreements by date (like the screenshot)
   - Filter capabilities (Time Period, Parties, Document Type)
   - AI-Assisted insights
   - Download options

**INVESTIGATION STEPS:**

1. API Documentation:
   - Find official Navigator reporting docs
   - Document all available endpoints
   - Note authentication requirements
   - List available report types

2. Network Analysis:
   - Use browser dev tools in Navigator
   - Capture request/response patterns
   - Document request headers
   - Note query parameters

3. Data Structure:
   ```typescript
   // Document the response type
   interface AgreementReport {
     timeRange: string;
     dataPoints: Array<{
       date: string;
       count: number;
     }>;
     filters?: {
       parties?: string[];
       documentType?: string[];
     };
   }
   ```

4. Chart Requirements:
   - Identify required chart library
   - Note customization options
   - Document filter interactions
   - List required UI components

**DELIVERABLES:**

1. API Documentation Summary:
   ```markdown
   ## Navigator Reporting API

   ### Authentication
   - Required headers
   - Token requirements
   - Permissions needed

   ### Endpoints
   - List all discovered endpoints
   - Document parameters
   - Show example responses

   ### Rate Limits
   - Document any limits found
   - Note batch capabilities
   ```

2. Implementation Plan:
   ```typescript
   // Proposed tool structure
   const getAgreementReport = {
     name: 'getAgreementReport',
     description: 'Get agreement analytics and charts',
     parameters: z.object({
       timeRange: z.enum(['1M', '3M', '6M', '1Y']),
       filters: z.object({
         parties: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
         documentType: z.array(z.string()).optional()
       }).optional()
     })
   };
   ```

3. Chart Component Recommendations:
   - Suggested chart library
   - Required features
   - Mobile considerations
   - Accessibility needs

**PROOF OF COMPLETION:**

Provide:
1. Complete API documentation
2. Sample requests/responses
3. Chart implementation plan
4. UI component requirements

**IMPORTANT QUESTIONS:**

1. Authentication:
   - How does Navigator authenticate these requests?
   - What headers are required?
   - Are there special permissions needed?

2. Data Access:
   - Is this API generally available?
   - Are there beta requirements?
   - What account types can access it?

3. Rate Limiting:
   - What are the limits?
   - How to handle throttling?
   - Are there batch capabilities?

4. Chart Features:
   - What filtering is available?
   - How is AI assistance implemented?
   - What customization is possible?

Remember: Focus on replicating the exact functionality shown in the Navigator UI, with particular attention to the AI-Assisted features.

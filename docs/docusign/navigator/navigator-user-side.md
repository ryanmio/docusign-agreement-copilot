## Navigator Overview and Onboarding

Navigator solves the problem of organizations not having clear agreement visibility. This lack of visibility can cause
wasted time, revenue loss, and unnecessary exposure to risk. Worst of all, organizations are unable to take
advantage of the data trapped inside their agreements.

The primary use case for Navigator is that it empowers you to store, find, understand, and report on signed
agreements.

When the documents are ingested or uploaded into Navigator, AI-assisted insights are gleaned from the
agreements. These insights help you find, manage, and report on agreements, including managing renewals and
locating data to assist in negotiations.

See the Related Content section on the right for a complete list of AI-assisted insights and attribute definitions.

## AI Denotation in Navigator

Navigator relies on AI-assisted insights to provide insight to your agreements. Docusign uses the spark icon to
denote AI-assisted data or AI functionality. Features that use AI also display the AI-AssistedAI-Assisted denotation pill within
the product.

Methods of denoting AI functionality include:

- The spark icon
- An AI-AssistedAI-Assisted denotation pill
- A dashed outline around attribute values
- A dashed line under attribute values

The dashed outline or line indicates that the value was AI-assisted and must be validated by the user. Once the


values are validated against the agreement, the outline or line goes away.

The AI-Assisted AI-Assisted denotation pill is clickable. Select this pill to access additional information about how Docusign
uses AI functionality.

permissions, and settings.
```
Typical administrator tasks include:

- Managing user and group access to agreements in the repository
- Controlling agreement access across the organization
- Enabling users to bulk upload agreements to Navigator
- Enable cloud storage providers from the Docusign App Center

## Getting Started with Navigator for Administrators

Administrators are mostly responsible for user and group management in Navigator. Ongoing maintenance tasks
include:

- Managing agreement access for Navigator users and groups
- Granting bulk ingestion permissions
- Grant agreement type management permissions
- Installing third party cloud storage providers from the Docusign App Center
- Ingesting historical documents from eSignature (first time sync)
- Uploading documents from third party storage providers

```
Note: By default, all users in the account have Navigator access. Users have access to their sent and signed
agreements in eSignature. Administrators can grant some users and groups access to all agreements in the
account's Navigator.
```
After making changes to user or group permissions, verify the updates from the Audit Logs view.

See topics in the Related Content section on the right to learn how to perform various administrator functions.

## User and Group Management

```
Direct Sharing Access for Agreements in Navigator
Sync Files from eSignature
File Ingestion from Third-Party Cloud Storage Providers
```
## User and Group Management

Administrators are responsible for safeguarding access to agreements in Navigator. This includes ensuring the
appropriate users and groups can view or manage agreements and perform bulk uploads. Administrators also
manage group membership for Navigator groups. In some cases, you might want to restrict the ability to delete
agreements or update attributes to only a specific group.

```
Note: See the Docusign eSignature Admin Guide for more information about using the Admin menu to manage
users and groups. The Related Content section on the right also contains helpful links to learn more about user
and group management tasks.
```
**"Can View" versus "Can Manage"**

There are two options for granting access to all agreements in your account:

- Can View:Can View: authorizes users or groups to view and download agreements
- Can Manage:Can Manage: authorizes users or groups to view, edit, share, download, and delete agreements

```
Note: Agreements in Navigator are permanently stored unless explicitly deleted by a user with Can Manage Can Manage
permissions. eSignature retention is not applicable to Navigator.
```
```
Important: Users with Can ManageCan Manage access to Navigator agreements automatically have access to direct sharing
for agreements in the account. This permission is granted from the Docusign Admin page by an administrator.
```
```
However, users without Can ManageCan Manage Navigator access can still use the direct sharing functionality. Consider
these scenarios:
```
- If a user with Can ManageCan Manage Navigator access shares an agreement with another user or group, they can
    grant Can EditCan Edit or Can ManageCan Manage permission at the agreement-level. This makes it possible for a user


```
with Can ViewCan View Navigator access to have Can EditCan Edit or Can ManageCan Manage permission for a specific agreement
through direct sharing.
```
- When users upload agreements to Navigator, they are automatically granted Can ManageCan Manage access for
    the agreement. Therefore, they can directly share their uploaded agreements with other users.
- If a user is the sender or signer for an agreement that's been ingested to Navigator, they are
    automatically granted Can EditCan Edit access for the agreement. Therefore, they can directly share their
    uploaded agreements with other users.
- Users with Can EditCan Edit or Can ManageCan Manage permission at the agreement-level can use direct sharing to share
    the agreement with other users regardless of their Navigator access level.

**Bulk upload permission**

All users can upload up to five agreements to Navigator, however, the bulk upload feature requires an additional
permission. The Bulk uploadBulk upload permission is enabled from the Docusign Admin page. When enabled, users can
perform bulk uploads of more than five files.

**Group membership**

Administrators can manage group membership by adding and removing users from a group. Groups are managed
from the Docusign Admin page, where the administrator can:

- Add a user to an existing group
- Remove a user from an existing group
- Create a new group
- Bulk add and update users

```
Note: The Bulk AddBulk Add and Bulk UpdateBulk Update functions are described in the Docusign eSignature Admin guide. See the
User Bulk Actions topic for more information.

## Direct Sharing Access for Agreements in Navigator

Users can share agreements with other users and groups within the same account. It is important to understand the


permissions required to direct share agreements with others.

**Sources of agreement data**

There are three sources of agreement data for Navigator:

- **Docusign historical completed agreements:** agreements or documents associated with a completed
    eSignature envelope. Historical agreements that exist in your account today are auto-ingested into
    Navigator upon provisioning. These agreements cannot exceed 100,000 files.
- **3rd party agreements:** agreements completed outside of Docusign. For users with the correct
    permissions, these agreements can be bulk uploaded from local storage into Navigator.
- **Ongoing agreements from using Docusign IAM:** Agreements that automatically display in Navigator as
    they are completed. This includes agreements using various capabilities and platform services within
    Docusign IAM as well as external tools.

```
Note: Third-party agreements and ongoing agreements from using Docusign IAM do not have a 10,000 file limit.
```
Regardless of the source, ensuring only the right people have access to agreements is a top priority. Users with
access to the direct sharing feature can explicitly share agreements with other users and groups within their
account.

**Direct sharing scenario**

Consider the following scenario:

- Andy Admin uploads an agreement and wants to share the document with their manager, Molly.


- Andy uses the ShareShare function to share the agreement.
- After adding Molly's name, Andy selects Can ManageCan Manage as the access permission and completes the
    process.
- The agreement now displays in Molly's Completed documents view with manage permissions.
- When Andy uploaded the document, the manage permission was granted for the agreement. Molly wants
to remove Andy's access to the agreement.
- Molly uses the ShareShare function to view a list of users with access to the agreement. She locates Andy's
name in the People with access list, expands the dropdown, and selects RemoveRemove.
- The agreement no longer displays in Andy's Navigator view.
- Bobby has edit access to the agreement and wants to share it with the sales leadership team.
- Bobby uses the ShareShare function to share the agreement.
- After selecting the sales leadership group name, Bobby selects Can ViewCan View as the access permission
for the group.
- The agreement now displays in the Completed documents view for the sales leadership group.

**Permissions and rules**

The ShareShare function gives users access to share an agreement and set the access level for the recipients. There are
three available access permissions:

- Can Manage:Can Manage: users can edit attribute values, as well as delete, share, and remove access to the agreement
- Can Edit:Can Edit: users can edit attribute values and share and download the agreement
- Can View:Can View: users can read and download the agreement

```
Note: Users can only share an agreement with individuals and groups within their account. Users must have
Can EditCan Edit or Can ManageCan Manage access to an agreement to share the agreement with others.
```

- Users with manage access can share an agreement and assign edit, manage, or view access.
- Users with edit access can share an agreement and assign edit or view access.
- Users with manage access can revoke user and group access to an agreement.

```
Important: Users with Can ManageCan Manage access to Navigator agreements automatically have access to direct sharing
for agreements in the account. This permission is granted from the Docusign Admin page by an administrator.
```
```
However, users without Can ManageCan Manage Navigator access can still use the direct sharing functionality. Consider
these scenarios:
```
- If a user with Can ManageCan Manage Navigator access shares an agreement with another user or group, they can
    grant Can EditCan Edit or Can ManageCan Manage permission. This is an agreement-level permission. This makes it
    possible for a user with Can ViewCan View Navigator access to have Can EditCan Edit or Can ManageCan Manage permission for a
    specific agreement through direct sharing.
- When users upload agreements to Navigator, they are automatically granted Can ManageCan Manage access for

## Groups can Share Agreements

The direct sharing feature gives users access to directly share agreements with other users and groups within their
account. Users with Can ManageCan Manage access to Navigator agreements automatically have access to direct sharing for
agreements in the account. This permission is granted from the Docusign Admin page.


```
Important: Users without Can ManageCan Manage Navigator access can still use the direct sharing functionality. Consider
these scenarios:
```
- If a user with Can ManageCan Manage access shares an agreement with another user or group, they can grant Can Can
    EditEdit or Can ManageCan Manage permission. This permission is granted at the agreement-level. This makes it
    possible for a user with Can ViewCan View Navigator access to have Can EditCan Edit or Can ManageCan Manage permission for a
    specific agreement through direct sharing.
- When users upload agreements to Navigator, they are automatically granted Can ManageCan Manage access for
    the agreement. Therefore, they can directly share their uploaded agreements with other users.
- If a user is the sender or signer for an agreement that's been ingested to Navigator, they are
    automatically granted Can EditCan Edit access for the agreement. Therefore, they can directly share their
    uploaded agreements with other users.
- Users with Can EditCan Edit or Can ManageCan Manage permission at the agreement-level can use direct sharing to share

## Sync Files from eSignature

When an organization first accesses Navigator, the repository is empty. Account administrators are prompted to
configure sync settings to ingest completed agreements from eSignature envelopes. Once sync settings are
configured, Navigator continues to ingest eSignature agreements based on the filters that were applied during the
initial sync setup.

Sync settings are configured from the Sync file from eSignature page:

filters are used to ingest only the files that match the filters that you applied. Filter options include:

- Creation Date Creation Date
- Recipients Recipients
- Template Template
- Completion Date Completion Date

Continue applying filters until the list reflects the type of files you want to sync to Navigator. These filters can be
updated at any time after the initial sync by accessing the Sync eSignature filesSync eSignature files function:

## File Ingestion from Third-Party Cloud Storage Providers

The Navigator document upload experience includes the ability to upload files from third-party cloud storage
providers. This experience also includes the ability to choose which files you want to upload. Benefits of this
enhanced ingestion process include:

- Simplified agreement storage - you no longer have to manage agreements in multiple storage locations
- Improved internal collaboration
- Single source of truth for signed agreements
- Ability to surface agreement data that would otherwise be sitting unused in cloud storage

The upload process supports the following third-party cloud storage providers:

- Box
- Dropbox
- Google Drive
- OneDrive
- SharePoint

Cloud storage providers must first be installed and enabled from the Docusign App Center. This task must be
completed by an account administrator.

```
Important: If these apps were previously installed from the Docusign App Center, you must uninstall and
reinstall them. Due to versioning issues, backward compatibility is not currently possible.
```
```
Note: See the Organization Administrators article to learn more about the required permissions.
```

The Enable Cloud Storage Providers from the Docusign App Center article walks you through the steps to install and
enable cloud storage providers. Once enabled, you can choose files from your cloud storage locations to upload to
Navigator for AI processing.

## The Agreement Preview Page and the Details Pane

The Agreement preview page has two primary components:

- The Details pane on the left displays attributes and AI-assisted insights.
- The preview pane on the right displays an image of the full contents of the agreement.


```
Tip: Select DownloadDownload from the top-right corner to download a PDF version of the selected document. Expand
the DownloadDownload dropdown and select ShareShare to share the agreement with other users or groups.
```
For contract managers and analysts, the Agreement preview page and Details pane provides a look into the actual
agreement.

Validate the AI-assisted insights to ensure the accuracy of the suggested values. If an attribute is not listed in the
Details pane, you may want to find it in the document.

- Select the [Ctrl]-[f][Ctrl]-[f] (magnifying glass) icon from the bottom of the preview pane. A Search dialog box
    opens.
- Enter a keyword or search string in the SearchSearch field. If present, the keyword or search string is highlighted
    in the agreement.
- Use the NextNext and PreviousPrevious arrows to scroll through instances of the search term within the agreement.

```
Tip: If the attribute has an AI-assisted insight, select (click) the attribute to view the value within the context of
the agreement. The agreement jumps to the location of the value and highlights it:
```

```
Note: The spark icon indicates AI-assisted insights.
```
Data reviews are performed to validate the AI-assisted insights. This is an important aspect of Navigator. Business
decisions, negotiations, and renewals rely on the accuracy of these insights.

**Key elements of the Details pane**

When the Details pane is in edit mode, the attribute values can be updated, deleted, and verified.

When you select either the EditEdit (pencil) icon or the Review AllReview All button, each attribute value becomes editable. The


spark icon indicates that the value is an AI-assisted insight. Manually entered attribute values do not have a
spark icon.

```
Important: Any changes made to the attribute values in the Details pane do not change the content of the
actual document.
```
During a data review, you can:

- Accept the AI-assisted insight for an attribute.
- Delete the AI-assisted insight for an attribute and enter a new value.
- Enter a custom value if the AI-assisted insight is not an exact match (applies to attributes with dropdowns).
- View the AI-assisted insight within the agreement to validate it against the agreement. Select (click) an
    attribute with an AI-assisted insight to view the value in the context of the agreement. The agreement
    jumps to the location of the value and highlights it.

When you accept a value, that value becomes saved as the attribute value and the spark no longer displays.

**Saving changes to the Details pane**

When you select SaveSave without making changes to the Details pane, the AI-assisted insights, including the spark
icon, remain. The spark icon displays until a user validates the AI-assisted insights.

- Select the AcceptAccept checkmark and SaveSave your changes to validate the AI-assisted insight.
- If you manually edited the attribute value and SaveSave your changes, the spark icon goes away. The entered
    value is now the verified attribute value.
- If you do not accept or manually update attribute values before saving, the document remains in the
    review queue.

Once you select SaveSave, the Details pane reverts to read-only mode.

**Agreement details from eSignature documents**

When preparing agreements for an envelope or template, the preparer can add the following agreement detail
fields:

- Automatic Renewal (checkbox)
- Contract Value
- Effective Date
- Expiration Date


- Renewal Notice Period
- Renewal Term

By adding these fields and entering their values, the preparer simplifies the review process on the completed
agreement and ensures greater accuracy. These values display in the Details pane in Navigator for the completed
document. Once in Navigator, these attribute values are used for contract analytics, forecasting, renewals
management, and reporting purposes.

See the following topics to learn more about adding these fields to your eSignature envelopes and templates:

## Direct Sharing and Agreement Downloads

can use the DownloadDownload function for agreements to which they have access.

**Direct sharing for Navigator agreements**

Before using the ShareShare function, it's important to understand which permissions are required for sharing
agreements with others.

The ShareShare function gives users access to share an agreement and set the access level for the recipients. There are
three available access permissions:


- Can Manage:Can Manage: users can edit attribute values, as well as delete, share, and remove access to the agreement
- Can Edit:Can Edit: users can edit attribute values and share and download the agreement
- Can View:Can View: users can read and download the agreement

- Users with edit access can share an agreement and assign edit or view access.
- Users with manage access can revoke user and group access to an agreement.

Even without Can ManageCan Manage Navigator access, users can still use the direct sharing functionality. For example, when
users upload agreements to Navigator, they are automatically granted Can ManageCan Manage access for the agreement.
Therefore, they can directly share their uploaded agreements with other users.

**Downloading Navigator agreements**

The DownloadDownload function is available to all users for any agreement to which they have Navigator access. For example,
you may want to download an agreement to share with key stakeholders, for example during negotiations.

The DownloadDownload function is available from two locations in Navigator:

- The Completed documents table
- The Agreement preview page

Once the agreement is downloaded to your local Downloads folder, you can share it with key stakeholders or save it


for future use.

## Agreement Upload and Monitoring

Uploading third-party agreements is an important part of Navigator. There are two upload options for Navigator:

- Bulk upload
- Single document upload


```
Note: Historical documents, such as completed agreements from eSignature envelopes, are automatically
ingested into Navigator and display in the Completed documents list. The number of Docusign historical
documents that you can ingest is based on the Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) plan that was
purchased. The agreement ingestion limit for Navigator is 100,000 documents.
```
All users can use the Upload documentsUpload documents function to upload up to five documents to Navigator. However,
administrators must grant permissions to users to bulk upload third-party documents to Navigator.

During upload, standard agreement data, or attribute values, are surfaced from all agreements uploaded to
Navigator.

**Selective ingestion and uploads**

During the upload or ingestion processes, users can choose which documents to move to Navigator for processing.
Selective ingestion applies to bulk uploads and can be used to upload or ingest files from:

- eSignature
- Cloud storage providers

```
Note: The ability to ingest documents from eSignature and upload files from third-party cloud storage providers
is currently only available to administrators.
```
**Supported file types**

The agreement upload process supports the following file types:

- Word (doc, docm, docx, dotm, dot, rtf, wpd, wps)
- Excel (csv, xlsm, xlsx, xls, xlsb)
- HTML (html, htm, xhtml, xml, asp)
- Images (bmp, gif, heic, jpeg, jpg, pdf, png, tif, tiff)
- PowerPoint (potx, pot, pps, ppsx, pptm, pptx, ppt)
- Txt

**Supported cloud storage providers**

Users can upload documents from third-party cloud storage providers, such as:

- Box


- Dropbox
- Google Drive
- OneDrive
- SharePoint

These cloud storage devices must be enabled within the Docusign App Center by an administrator.

```
Note: The ability to upload documents from third-party cloud storage providers is currently only available to
administrators.
```
**Single document upload**

All users can upload up to five documents directly from their local computer to Navigator. Once uploaded, these
documents are visible to users and groups with permission to view the uploader's sent agreements. These users
must have at least Can ViewCan View agreements access.

Limitations of single document upload include:

- File names must be fewer than 128 characters

## Renewals Management

Renewals management helps you use agreement data to act on renewals and terminations. This functionality helps
organizations achieve:

- **Operational efficiency** by providing one source of truth and automated processes that help keep
    stakeholders informed of terminated or auto-renewed agreements.
- **Cost savings** by making users aware of upcoming renewals and terminations. Organizations waste money
    when they unintentionally miss renegotiation and termination windows for agreements that no longer
    serve any purpose.
- **Increased revenue** by enabling users to proactively contact customers for renewals while cutting down on
    unintentional terminations.
- **Compliance:** by ensuring you don’t miss important dates so you stay compliant.
- **Competitive advantage:** by increasing your sales cycle you can gain a competitive advantage.

Three main tools or functions support renewals management:

1. The Renewals dashboard displays filterable charts about agreements in Navigator:
    - Agreements by renewal type
    - Agreements with renewal notice date


2. Renewal email notifications inform users of upcoming renewals.
3. Data validation ensures the accuracy of renewal-related attribute values within agreements. These values
    drive insight into agreement renewals. They feed into the Renewals dashboard and the email notifications.

The primary users of renewals management functionality are contract managers, procurement managers, legal
operations managers, and sales operations managers. The following table lists the use cases for each role.

```
Role Use cases
```
```
Contract managers Visibility into which agreements automatically renew to ensure enough
time to:
```
- Renegotiate for more favorable terms
- Terminate the contract window

```
Ability to recognize the status or relationship with a counter-party when an
agreement has been renewed or terminated.
```
```
The ability to see when renewal notices are due to better plan workloads.
```
```
Procurement managers Ability to identify when agreements are up for renewal ahead of the due
date notice. Extra time is required to determine if the organization wants to
renew, terminate, or amend.
```
```
Visibility into the dollar amount involved in a renewal, including cost
savings by renegotiating or terminating the contract.
```
```
Legal operations managers An accurate and systematic way to track renewal information without
resorting to manual processes.
```
```
Access management to ensure that the right stakeholders have access to
agreements for upcoming renewals or expiration.
```
```
Sales operations managers Sales support to ensure that teams have accurate information about
renewals so they can proactively secure the renewal or upsell.
```

## Components of the Renewals Dashboard

The Renewals dashboard displays renewal data based on the attribute values within agreements in Navigator. The
dashboard refreshes every 15 minutes to account for new agreements or agreements with manually updated
renewal-related attribute values. The refresh is designed to ensure that all agreements are represented in the
dashboard.

```
Important: Data validation is an important part of renewal management. If the renewal-related AI-assisted
insights are inaccurate, the data displayed in the Renewals dashboard is not accurate. This process relies on the
verification of both the AI-assisted insights and the manually entered attribute values.
```
The Renewals dashboard contains charts about the agreements in Navigator and a table of agreements matching
selected filters. Access the dashboard from the email notification or by selecting ReportsReports > RenewalsRenewals.

**Renewals dashboard charts:**

The charts at the top of the dashboard display:

- Renewal types: This chart displays renewing agreements with a renewal type attribute value, including
    agreements with an unspecified renewal type.
- Agreements with renewal notice date: This chart contains agreements with the renewal notice date
    attribute value.

The segments or bars in the dashboard charts are clickable:


- Hover your cursor over a segment or bar to view the number of agreements represented in that part of the
    chart.
- Select a segment or bar to view the agreements represented in that part of the chart. The dashboard is
    updated to display the agreements represented in the selected segment.

```
Note: Information in these charts is an estimate only and contains results based on verified and unverified AI
suggestions. These estimates are only as accurate as the AI-assisted insights. Be sure to validate renewal-
related attribute values within Navigator agreements.
```
**Renewals dashboard table:**

The table displays a list of agreements represented within the charts, including the following attribute values if
available:

- File name
- Parties
- Total contract value
- Renewal type
- Expiration date
- Renewal notice date

Use the sorting arrows located in the column headers to sort the table by the corresponding attribute.

**Filter pills:**

Filter pills display at the top of the Renewals dashboard. The filter selections apply to the entire page, including the
charts and table. More than one filter can be applied to locate relevant renewal information. Filters include:


- Renewal Type Renewal Type
- Expiration Date Expiration Date
- Renewal Notice Date Renewal Notice Date
- Parties Parties
- Total Contract Value Total Contract Value
- Renewal Term Renewal Term
- Renewal Notice Period Renewal Notice Period

## Agreement Type Management

**Definition and benefits**

Agreement type management is the process of organizing, categorizing, and managing different types of
documents within an organization. This involves defining, standardizing, and overseeing specific structures, fields
(attributes), and processes related to different types of documents.

Contract managers and analysts benefit from agreement type management, as it provides:


- **Standardization and consistency:** Agreements follow a standardized format making it easier to mitigate
    risks, track renewals, and ensure compliance with policies.
- **Efficient workflows:** Organizing agreements into distinct types help automate and streamline tasks, such
    as approval processes and renewals management.
- **Risk mitigation:** Managing agreement types makes it easier to manage risk and tailor strategies to the
    nature of the agreement.
- **Compliance and legal requirements:** Certain types of agreements require adherence to specific legal and
    regulatory standards.
- **Improved reporting and analytics:** Categorizing agreements by type leads to more accurate reports and
    insights.
- **Negotiation and approval clarity:** Predefined agreement types make the negotiation and approval
    processes clearer and faster.
- **Contract lifecycle management:** Agreement type management helps track key milestones and deadlines
    based on the type of agreement.

Effective agreement type management ensures that documents are handled in a consistent, efficient, and legally
compliant manner. As a result, the organization is protected from potential risks and enhancing operational
efficiency.

**Agreement type management at Docusign**

Organizations use agreement type management to configure their agreement types and fields in one central place.
Centrally storing your agreement types provides:

- One source of truth for agreement data throughout the agreement lifecycle
- A unified end-to-end experience across different Docusign offerings
- A more intuitive user experience

Navigator supports a number of different agreement types. However, since every organization is unique, this list
does not cover every type of agreement they may have with customers and vendors. This is particularly important
to B2B sales organizations. Organizations can now create and categorize custom agreement types to support their
use cases.

With the ability to manage custom agreement types, Navigator users can:

- **Enhance agreement organization:** Locate and manage agreements more quickly and efficiently by
    customizing sales-related agreements.
- **Boost reporting accuracy:** Reports include additional details and insights related to custom agreement
    types.
- **Reduce errors and risk:** Agreements are categorized more accurately and help minimize non-compliance
    risks.


**Relevant fields by agreement type**

Every agreement type is associated with a list of standard fields. These standard fields are automatically added to
the agreement type to provide structure.

See the Agreement Types and Relevant Fields topic for a list of standard fields for each Docusign agreement type.

## Create New Agreement Types

Navigator supports a number of different agreement types. However, since every organization is unique, this list
does not cover every type of agreement they may have with customers and vendors. Organizations can create new
agreement types to support their use cases.

1. Log in to your Docusign account.
    The Docusign Home page opens.
2. Select AgreementsAgreements from the global header.
    The Docusign Agreements page opens.
3. Select NavigatorNavigator from the navigation pane on the left.
    The Completed documents view opens.
4. Expand the More actionsMore actions menu (vertical ellipses) from the right-side of the page and select the Manage Manage
    Agreement TypesAgreement Types option.

```
The Manage Types dialog box opens. The Agreement Types view is displayed. Existing agreement types are
categorized and grouped under three tabs: Business ServicesBusiness Services, Human ResourcesHuman Resources, and MiscellaneousMiscellaneous.
```
5. Select + New Agreement Type+ New Agreement Type.
    The New agreement type dialog box opens.


6. Enter a name for the agreement type in the NameName field. The name cannot exceed 50 characters.
7. Enter a description for the agreement type in the DescriptionDescription field. The description cannot exceed 130
    characters. This information displays on the Agreement type details view for a selected agreement type.
8. Expand the dropdown and select the relevant CategoryCategory for the agreement type from the list. Agreement
    types are grouped based on their primary use case or category.
9. Select SaveSave.
    The Agreement type details view opens for the newly created agreement type. Standard contract fields
    were automatically added to the agreement type.


10. Review the list of standard contract fields as needed. These values are automatically surfaced in your
    documents for this agreement type.

## Party Management

When agreements enter Navigator, key attribute values are surfaced with AI, such as the party name. Because AI is
used to capture the party name from agreements, slight name variations result in duplicate parties.

For example: Tally versus Tally, Inc. versus Tally Inc. results in the creation of three separate parties. In reality, they
all represent the same party.

This creates difficulty when filtering to locate agreements for a specific party. Duplicate parties means you must
select all variations of the party name to see all the agreements for the organization.

**Key functionality**

Party management helps you holistically understand the state of a contractual relationship with a specific party.

```
Important: The party management functionality is not intended to manage party relationships or hierarchy
between parent and subsidiary parties.
```
Key functionality includes:

- **Duplicate identification:** Navigator alerts users when one or more ingested agreements contain duplicate
    party names.
- **Party reconciliation:** Users can merge and reconcile duplicate party names into a single, preferred party
    name. The preferred name displays in the PARTIESPARTIES column in the Completed documents list and in the
    Party filter.

```
Note: Once merged under a preferred party name, that name displays when new agreements are
ingested to Navigator for that party.
```
- **Party unmerge:** If party names were merged by mistake, you can unmerge associated parties and


```
agreements.
```
**Permissions: Can Manage**

Users with the Can ManageCan Manage permission can perform the following:

- View identified duplicate parties
- Merge duplicate parties together
- Select the preferred party name
- Merge party alias groups
- Unmerge parties

**Permissions: Can View**

Users with Can ViewCan View permission can perform the following:

- Filter the agreements list based on the preferred name of a party
- View agreements associated with a specific party

```
Note: For merged parties, the preferred name displays in the PartyParty filter. For non-merged parties, the original
party name displays in the PartyParty filter.
```
**Party management tasks**

Party management tasks can be completed by any user with Can ManageCan Manage access to Navigator.

```
Important: Even administrators must have Can ManageCan Manage access to perform party management tasks.
```
Users with the Can ManageCan Manage permission can:

- Identify and merge duplicate parties to normalize party names
- Merge party names together
- Set a preferred party name to use as the display name when filtering agreements
- Merge party alias groups
- Unmerge party names if they were previously merged by mistake

A message displays in the All Parties view when parties with similar names exist in Navigator. The message prompts
you to Review and MergeReview and Merge the records:


During the merge process, you must choose a preferred name to display in various filters. Once you merge parties,
the preferred name displays in the Name column in the All Parties list. A list of merged parties displays under the
preferred name.

For example, a number of parties were merged under Tally Communications Inc. Hover the cursor over the list of

## AI-Assisted Insights and Attribute Definitions for Navigator Agreements

AI-assisted insights use Docusign AI to automatically capture the contractual terms and data that matter to your
organization. These insights drive greater efficiency and improve risk management. With AI-assisted insights, you
can:

- **Boost internal productivity** by spending less time manually capturing and tracking data and more time
    focused on strategic work.
- **Make more informed decisions** by using AI-assisted insights to surface critical agreement terms.
- **Expose more potential risks** and monitor compliance with more consistent and reliable agreement
    records.

```
Note: Navigator is now available to customers globally (with the exception of Japan), but features and AI-
assisted insights vary by region and language. See the Language and Regional Support topic for additional
information related to region and language availability.
```
```
Important:
```
```
Docusign's Release 2 for calendar year 2024 includes new AI-assisted insights in addition to the standard
insights previously available. These additional insights are enabled for all newly ingested and uploaded
Navigator agreements from that point onwards.
```
```
Your existing corpus of agreements must be processed with these additional insights. The time required to
complete this processing depends on the volume of agreements stored in Navigator and the number of
processing jobs in the queue. This processing gives you additional insights and does not degrade your current
experience in any way.
```
Use the AI-assisted insights, or attribute values, to do the following:

- Filter the Completed documents table
- Perform a search query to locate agreements
- Manage renewals (populated with renewal-related attribute values)
- Filter and view agreement reports


```
CAUTION: The accuracy and appropriateness of AI-assisted insights may vary depending on the agreement
language and customer use case. Customers should always review AI-assisted insights for accuracy and to
determine whether the AI-assisted insight is appropriate for its particular circumstances.
```
```
Important: Validate all AI-assisted insights to ensure accuracy when using these attributes for filtering,
searching, renewals management, and reporting. Review and validate attribute values from the Agreement
details pane for a selected agreement.

Description
```
```
insights may vary depending on the agreement
language and customer use case.
```
```
Customers should always review AI-assisted insights for
accuracy and to determine whether the AI-assisted
insight is appropriate for its particular circumstances.
```
**Navigator is best fit for customers with fewer than
100,000 Docusign historical completed agreements** Ingesting high volumes of Docusign^ historical
completed agreements could result in a slight
onboarding delay for new customers.

```
The amount of Docusign historical completed
agreements to be ingested into Navigator per customer
is dependent on the specifics of the IAM Application
purchased.
```
**Navigator is not fully compatible with Docusign CLM** CLM is expected to be fully connected to Navigator in
2025.

**Navigator does not support custom AI-assisted
insights** Currently, the AI models that power Navigator only
support out-of-the-box insights. Support for custom
insights is on the roadmap.

```
See the AI-Assisted Insights and Attribute Definitions for
Navigator Agreements topic for a list of supported
insights.
```
**Navigator will be issued at the account level** Customers with multiple eSignature accounts will
receive one instance of Navigator for each account.

**Navigator is not FedRAMP and StateRAMP certified** For customers in regulated industries, Navigator is not
yet FedRAMP and StateRAMP certified.

**Navigator users cannot choose which documents are
automatically ingested from eSignature**

```
All Docusign historical completed agreements will be
automatically ingested upon provisioning. Users cannot
select specific documents or subsets of documents to
be auto-ingested into Navigator.
```
**Navigator only displays completed agreements** Navigator does not display in-flight agreements.


```
Limitations and Considerations
```
```
(including limitations related to regional expansion)
```
```
Description
```
```
Navigator does not provide a document sharing
notification
```
```
When an agreement is shared with users or groups, they
do not receive a notification about the shared
agreement.
```
```
Renewals Dashboard charts are not clickable The bars or sections of the graphs and charts on the
Renewals Dashboard are not clickable.
```
```
Granting group permissions from Admin for the
“Everyone” group does not have any effect
```
```
Groups can normally be granted permissions to view or
manage all agreements in Navigator for the account.
This is not the case for the “Everyone” group, even if the
UI lets administrators configure it.
```
```
Sharing agreements with the “Everyone” group does
not have any effect
```
```
When sharing agreements, users can select users and
groups in the account to grant them view, edit, or
manage access. This works for any user or group in the
account except for the “Everyone” group, even though
that group is selectable in the UI.
```
```
Navigator does not support duplicate agreement
detection
```
```
Navigator does not recognize when duplicate
agreements have been ingested or uploaded to the
repository. If the same agreement was uploaded twice,
users with the Can ManageCan Manage permission can manually
delete agreements as needed.
```
## Docusign FAQs for AI

This FAQ was updated on December 2, 2024 to provide additional clarity and information in regard to Docusign AI
practices and policies.

Trust, privacy, and transparency have always been at the core of Docusign, and our work with AI is no different. The
following FAQ shares additional details about the use of AI in Docusign products and programs.

**Does Docusign use my data for AI model training and**

**improvement?**

There are limited instances where Docusign uses anonymized data from customers who provide consent to
Docusign to improve our AI models so our AI-powered features can deliver greater value for our customers.
Previously, Docusign used anonymized data from consenting customers who used Docusign AI Extension for CLM or
participated in select beta programs. Customers using these products provide explicit contractual consent when


they sign an agreement to purchase or participate in Docusign programs using AI.

On May 30, 2024, Docusign introduced the AI Data ControlsAI Data Controls setting. Moving forward, Docusign will use anonymized
data only from customers who have given explicit consent through their contract and who have the AI Data AI Data
ControlsControls setting turned onon.

The AI Data ControlsAI Data Controls setting is an in-product AI data sharing setting that provides additional, built-in controls for
your organization’s account administrator to manage whether your organization's data is used for training
purposes. For customers who provide contractual consent, account administrators can turn this setting offoff or onon at
any time, using the in-product controls. If a customer’s authorized representative has not provided contractual
consent, the in-product toggle will be disabled and set to offoff and cannot be changed by an account administrator.
Only documents sent or uploaded by consenting Docusign accounts will be used for training. Additionally, Docusign
only uses data that is aggregated and anonymized before training occurs.

See the AI Data Controls Setting FAQs topic for more information about this setting.

**In cases where Docusign uses my data for AI model training and**

**improvement, how is my data protected and secured?**

Docusign trains AI models on data from customers only if a customer has given consent, and the data is
anonymized and aggregated before training occurs.

For customers that have given explicit consent, Docusign takes a multi-pronged privacy and security-centric
approach to protect data privacy and confidentiality including: anonymization, aggregation, and encryption.

The Docusign anonymization process removes identifiers such as names, addresses, bank account information, and
social security numbers (SSNs)/national tax numbers from data used for model training. These measures are
designed to prevent data from being used to re-identify or trace back to an individual or organization. For
additional security, data is always encrypted in transit and rest.

**Which AI models does Docusign use for AI features?**

Docusign utilizes both proprietary AI models developed in-house, which are based on customized open-source AI
models, and third-party models such as Microsoft Azure OpenAI service.

**When Docusign partners with third-party models such as**

**Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, how is a customer’s data used**

**and protected?**

When working with third-party models such as Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, Docusign and its partners agree on
robust protections to safeguard the data privacy and security of our customers and our users. For Microsoft Azure
OpenAI Service specifically, there is:


- **No improvements to Microsoft or Azure products:** Data from Docusign customers is not used to improve
    any Microsoft or third-party products or services, including Azure OpenAI Service models.
- **No persistent data storage during AI processing:** Data from Docusign customers is not persistently
    stored in the Azure OpenAI Service.
- **Bias filtering and responsible AI:** Docusign uses the Azure bias and offensiveness detection models to
    process and filter AI output.
